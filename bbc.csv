Trump golf resorts claimed over £3m in furlough,"Donald Trump's golf courses and leisure businesses in Scotland claimed over Â£3m in UK government furlough money, newly-published accounts show.Covid restrictions caused substantial losses at Trump resorts in Ayrshire and Aberdeenshire with both companies reducing staff. Trump Turnberry saw turnover more than halved and it recorded a loss of more than Â£3m in 2020.The other course and resort at Balmedie also reported a loss, of Â£1.3m.Donald Trump's mother came from the Isle of Lewis, and the former US president is said to have spoken fondly of his Scottish ancestry. He opened his first golf resort on the Menie estate in Aberdeenshire in 2012, amid opposition over potential environmental damage, and later tried to stop a wind farm being built off the coast, arguing it would spoil the view. In 2014 he bought the Turnberry golf resort in South Ayrshire from a Dubai-based company.He handed control of both courses to his sons Donald Junior and Eric shortly before he became president in 2017, but he retained a financial interest. Critics of Mr Trump recently lost a legal bid to force the Scottish government to investigate how he paid for the courses, using an unexplained wealth order. According to accounts filed with Companies House, Golf Recreation Scotland Ltd, which owns the Turnberry golf course and resort, saw turnover fall from Â£19.7m in 2019 to Â£6.7m in 2020.It made a profit of Â£321,000 in 2019, and a loss of Â£3.4m in 2020.The resort was closed from 23 March to 15 July 2020, and again from 20 November to 26 April 2021.The company received a total of Â£2.3m in grants under the furlough scheme in 2020, the accounts say, while the average number of employees fell from 541 to 289.A subsidiary of the company, SLC Turnberry Ltd, made further furlough claims of between Â£435,000 and Â£1.1m from January to August 2021, according to government data not included in the published accounts. ""Government support was helpful to retain as many jobs as possible, however, uncertainty of the duration of support and the pandemic's sustained impact meant that redundancies were required to prepare the business for the long term effects to the hospitality industry,"" say the accounts, signed by Eric Trump.Trump International Golf Club Scotland Limited, which owns Donald Trump's golf course in Aberdeenshire, also saw a steep drop in turnover, from Â£3.3m in 2019 to Â£1.1m in 2020, although the company's losses rose only slightly, from Â£1.1m to Â£1.3m.The accounts note that while golf was permitted for much of the year, the Macleod House hotel was closed from 21 March onwards, and the restaurants and dining facilities only opened in June and closed again on 20 November.""The UK government furlough scheme was helpful to retain as many jobs as possible, and the majority of employees were reinstated over the course of the year,"" the accounts say.The company received Â£452,000 in from the furlough scheme in 2020, according to the accounts.Separately, government data shows that Trump International Golf Club Scotland Limited claimed between Â£85,000 and Â£205,000 of furlough money from January to August 2021.The average number of employees fell from 84 in 2019 to 63 in 2020, the accounts show.The ultimate controlling parties of both companies are the trustees of the Donald J Trump Revocable Trust, registered in Florida, the accounts say.",0.08
Five big questions about Trump and the riot,"It has been nearly a year since a mob of Donald Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol in an attempt to halt the certification of Joe Biden's presidential victory. The most comprehensive account of the events leading up to and during that day is still ongoing, the focus of a special House of Representatives committee set up for that purpose.Established in a contentious 1 July House vote after attempts to create an independent inquiry failed, the committee - made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans - has conducted more than 250 interviews and issued at least 45 subpoenas over the course of its investigation.According to committee members, most of those contacted have agreed to co-operate. A handful of those closest to Donald Trump, however, have resisted. They've cited executive privilege, a legal principle that protects candid communications between presidents and their advisors. Two so far, Trump confidante Steve Bannon and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, have been cited for contempt of Congress by the House. Bannon is facing a criminal trial next year. Others, like former Trump advisor Roger Stone and Trump ally Alex Jones have invoked the Fifth Amendment to avoid answering questions on their role.As its investigatory work â and legal battles â continue, there are a number of gaps and key questions that the committee is seeking to address. Here are a few of the most pressing ones.Bennie Thompson, the chair of the congressional investigation, recently set out some of what his committee is trying to learn about the Washington DC rallies that served as a precursor to the attack on the Capitol.""We need to know who organised, planned, paid for and received funds related to those events, as well as what communications organisers had with officials in the White House and Congress,"" he said.One of those organisers, far-right conservative activist Ali Alexander, has already testified to the committee â and said he was in touch with the White House and Republican members of Congress ahead of time.The exact nature of these contacts have yet to be publicly revealed.Alexander's public opening statement during his committee deposition laid some of the blame for the day on the leaders of Women for America First, which organised the event near the White House at which Trump told his supporters to march to the Capitol. He said they did little to tamp down the violence and may have been at a hotel a block from the White House, ""drinking champagne"" when the Capitol was attacked.The activities at that hotel, the Willard Intercontinental, have been of particular interest to the congressional committee. Steve Bannon, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, former Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and Trump confidant Roger Stone were a few of the prominent names linked to hotel gatherings. The committee indicated in its contempt of Congress resolution that it believes Bannon had direct contact with Trump about the 6 January rally on at least one occasion. And Jones said that the White House asked him to lead the march to the Capitol.After weeks of calls, tweets and unsuccessful legal battles, Trump set his sights on 6 January as the pivotal day that would determine whether he could successfully overturn the results of the election.""Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,"" he tweeted on 19 December. ""Be there, will be wild!""He followed that up 11 days later with another tweet: ""JANUARY SIXTH, SEE YOU IN DC!""According to a report by the Washington Post, there was ample evidence that right-wing militant groups were preparing to travel to the Capitol on 6 January and that they were taking their guidance from the president's public statements.Federal law enforcement and the US military, however, were reluctant to make extensive moves to prepare, for fear of drawing the president's attention â and ire. A suggestion by Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Mark Milley to lock down the capital city was dismissed as being too provocative. Milley, according to the Post, was also concerned military forces dispatched to Washington could receive countermanding orders from the president.On 5 January, Bannon said on his podcast, recorded at the Willard Hotel, that a ""revolution"" was coming and ""all hell is going to break loose tomorrow"".That same evening, Trump â after reportedly hearing the growing crowds of supporters gathered outside the White House â tweeted: ""Washington is being inundated with people who don't want to see an election victory stolen by emboldened Radical Left Democrats. Our Country has had enough, they won't take it anymore!"" Several of the rally organisers, according to a report by the investigative journalism website ProPublica, were concerned that 6 January might turn violent â and the march from the White House to the Capitol was of particular concern.""A last-minute march, without a permit, without all the metro police that'd usually be there to fortify the perimeter, felt unsafe,"" Dustin Stockton, one of the White House rally organisers who has been subpoenaed by the committee, told ProPublica.Stockton wanted these concerns passed along to the White House, something he says he was assured took place. During his White House speech, however, Trump specifically encouraged rally attendees to head to the Capitol. He said they should do so ""peacefully and patriotically,"" but at other points told them to ""fight like hell"".Ever since the days of Richard Nixon, presidential scandals have been defined by two questions. What did the president know, and when did he know it? Those are still relevant in the Capitol attack investigation, but there's also a third: What did the president do once he knew?A big chunk of the committee's investigation has been trying to piece together the president's activities on 6 January â before, during and after the attack. It's why the committee has engaged in a protracted legal battle to obtain documents â call and meeting logs, notes and speech drafts â from the National Archives related to that day.Already there are some details about the pressure the president was under to respond more forcefully when the Capitol came under attack.Republican Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler has recounted how Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy phoned the president and urged him to call off the attackers. When the president demurred, the conversation devolved into an obscenity-laden shouting match.Republican Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville also spoke with the president and told him things were not going ""very good"", adding that he and Vice-President Mike Pence were being evacuated from the Capitol.""I know we've got problems,"" Trump replied.White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows provided the investigating committee with text messages and emails he received from conservative television personalities and members of the president's own family, urging him to get the president to make a public address and take more action to stop the violence.""He has to lead now,"" Donald Trump Jr wrote. ""It has gone too far and gotten out of hand.""""I'm pushing it hard,"" Meadows replied.The president's actions, however, are the big black hole in the middle of the investigation. If Meadows pushed, how did the president respond? There are reports that the president spent most of the afternoon watching television in his private White House dining room. The committee has subpoenaed White House officials who may have been around the president that day and is currently in a legal fight over government records that may help to fill in some of that black hole.On the morning of 6 January, US Park Police were already clashing with pro-Trump protestors at the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. Officers were directed to stand back and ""monitor only"".After the Stop the Steal rally and Trump's speech urging the crowd to march to the Capitol, the violence escalated. Pro-Trump rioters attacked police around the Capitol and forced their way into the building, eventually occupying the Senate chamber and ransacking the offices of congressional leaders.Shortly before the rioters entered the Capitol itself, Major General William Walker, commander of the DC National Guard, made a request to acting Secretary of Defence Christopher Miller for permission to deploy his forces to handle the crisis. That authorisation wouldn't reach Walker for more than two hours, and National Guard soldiers would not arrive in numbers at the Capitol until an hour after that.The committee is looking for further evidence of communication between the Capitol and the Pentagon and contact, if any, between the Pentagon and top White House officials, including the president.The Capitol attack represented a stunning lapse of security in a seat of US governmental power, and there's still no clear idea who bears the most responsibility.One of the more remarkable revelations in the approximately 9,000 documents former Trump Chief-of-Staff Meadows turned over to the congressional committee before he stopped co-operating were emails about a 36-page PowerPoint presentation that circulated in the White House and among congressional Republicans.The exact author of the document has yet to be determined, but it contains many familiar and long-since invalidated claims of election fraud. What is extraordinary about it, however, is the scope of its recommendations. It suggested the president declare a national state of emergency, discard all electronically tabulated ballots and put a federalised National Guard in charge of overseeing a hand recount of paper ballots in key states.Such steps would have no precedent in US history. The committee is also looking into reports that the president was pressuring his own Justice Department to declare the election corrupt, telling senior officials, according to notes taken by one of the participants, that they should ""just say the election was corrupt (and) leave the rest to me and the (Republican) congressman"".On 3 January, the president reportedly contemplated forcing the resignation of acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen and replacing him with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general who had already drafted a letter to election officials Georgia suggesting that Biden's win was fraudulent and calling on them to declare Trump the rightful winner.The president backed down after Rosen and other Justice Department officials threatened to resign en masse. Clark has so far refused to co-operate with the 6 January inquiry and could be the next individual cited for contempt of Congress.Vice-President Mike Pence was the final target of Trump's pressure â and key members of his staff are currently co-operating with the congressional investigation. The committee is seeking to learn more about a White House meeting the two had on 4 January with John Eastman, a Chapman University law professor who believed Pence could throw out state results and declare Trump the president or, at the very least, delay certification of the results until Republican-controlled legislatures could move to support Trump.According to news reports, the pressure to discard the election results continued into the evening of 6 January, with Eastman informing Pence's legal counsel that there was still time for him to refuse to certify Biden's victory, even with the Capitol still full of lingering teargas fumes and broken glass from the day's violence.",0.049
Inside The Matrix's prophetic legacy,"""I don't know the future... I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end, I came here to tell you how it's going to begin.""The closing monologue of 1999's The Matrix saw Keanu Reeves' heroic character Neo deliver a stark warning to the world's controlling machines, having discovered that humanity was trapped in a simulated reality.Released as society lay on the cusp of the internet revolution and fretted over the millennium bug, the film not only tapped into technological developments of the time, but posed far-flung questions about the internet, consciousness and social control that have since come to shape society.As a fourth instalment, Matrix Resurrections, hits cinemas - 18 years on from the original trilogy drawing to a close - we look at the saga's enduring and often prophetic legacy. The Matrix's co-creator siblings Lana and Lilly Wachowski loosely based their dystopian vision on the work of French academic philosopher Jean Baudrillard. Long before Reeves donned Neo's trench coat and shades, they asked that he read Baudrillard's 1981 book Simulacra and Simulation to prepare for the role.It pondered a ""desert of the real"" - a world where true reality had been replaced by the illusions of capitalism.  The film took the concept, with rebel leader Morpheus using the exact phrase when introducing Neo to the ruins of the outside world, and rewired it. Where for Baudrillard there was no escape from the simulation, the Wachowskis offered hope in the ""promise of a true natural world 'unplugged' and separate from the Matrix"", explains Prof Richard Smith, editor of The Baudrillard Dictionary. Baudrillard was not a fan of the change. ""The Matrix is surely the kind of film about the matrix that the matrix would have been able to produce,"" he said.Either way, the rabbit hole had been opened. Here are four main ways it has hacked our reality.One of the most iconic scenes in The Matrix sees Morpheus offer Neo (then still living as curious hacker Thomas Anderson) a central choice of blue pill or red pill. Pop the blue pill and return to life as Mr Anderson blissfully unaware of the matrix, the simulated world created to covertly enslave humanity. Or swallow the red pill and become enlightened to reality and the tyranny of the machines. For Prof Smith, the film's Marxist narrative evokes Plato's allegory of chained prisoners in a cave ""who mistake the shadows on the wall for reality"".  As Morpheus puts it: ""The Matrix is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth."" The pill scene ""urges human beings to free themselves from the world of appearances"", says Prof Smith.But over time the film's cultural prominence has seen the red pill metaphor rebranded online for causes far removed from its original meaning.This includes its adoption by misogynistic online groups, notably the incel movement - young men describing themselves as ""involuntarily celibate"" - part of a ""manosphere"" closely tied to a hatred of women. Reddit forum TheRedPill (TRP) was launched in 2012 with the aim of providing men with a ""sexual strategy"" to defeat what it described as a manipulative ""feminist culture"" that solely empowers women. By the time it was ""quarantined"" by Reddit in 2018 (given a content warning and only made accessible via direct links), in a community clean-up drive that eventually saw incel forum r/braincels shut completely, it had more than 400,000 followers. Research on the measure from the Australian National University suggested that rather than limit hate speech, it had simply pushed many users off-site on to self-moderated platforms.In some cases the philosophy has moved offline with deadly consequences. Plymouth gunman Jake Davison spoke of ""consuming the black pill overdose"" in YouTube videos before his August killing spree - the incel community's own term for nihilistic red pill extremism.Journalist, author and social media creator Sophia Smith Galer says the offline transition reflects how at its most basic, red pill theory appeals as a readily accessible answer and misguided outlet for life's frustrations. ""The epicentre of their problems often becomes women, rather than real, systemic failings or stereotypes in society that hurt all of us - and then many share misogynist, violent or self-harming ideas about how to improve their lives,"" she told the BBC. The ""free your mind"" ethos exploited by red pill theory has also fed into politics - a byword for the modern age of far-right populism that positions itself as anti-establishment.As a product of the alt-right, whose members are generally outspoken in their attacks on multiculturalism, globalisation and immigration, the red pill becomes ""a verb"", wrote broadcaster Danny Leigh.It opened ""the eyes of new recruits to their hated oppressors - feminists, people of colour and progressives"", he said. ""Morpheus became the face of memes that asked: 'What If I Told You Hitler Was A Socialist?'.""Fuelled by a distrust of government, the media and the status quo, the alt-right was most evidently brought into mainstream Western politics by former US President Donald Trump and his supporters.  His own daughter, Ivanka, then a White House senior adviser, proudly quote-tweeted billionaire Elon Musk to say she had ""taken"" the red pill.   The tweet represented a complete reversal of Morpheus's red pill reality, says author James Ball. ""In the film, taking the red pill is to accept an alien and horrifying truth rather than stay in a comfortable delusion,"" he said. ""And yet red-pilling, as beloved by far-right and niche online groups, is to accept vile but comfortable groupthink, to suit your own preconceptions, and see the world in a framing that suits yourself.""Lilly Wachowski responded curtly, with a blunt two-word condemnation. Actor Hugo Weaving, who played Agent Smith in the original Matrix trilogy, has also said he is ""befuddled"" by the hijacking of the film's message. ""It just goes to show how people don't read below surfaces,"" he told The Daily Beast.The fact it is now so easy to fortify yourself in an online media echo chamber - a space devoid of balanced opinion - has led to claims we are living in a ""post-truth"" era. The term was even declared word of the year by Oxford Dictionaries after the Brexit and US presidential campaigns of 2016.Messaging apps and social media have helped this climate flourish, with promotion of fake news and by using algorithms that build a version of reality tailored to our tastes - rewarding partisan news content.This year's Reuters Institute Digital News Report found that while audiences increasingly value truth, only 44% believe the news they read. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok have continued to attract more young people, but frequently offer personality and opinion-led content devoid of fact-checks, the study added. Together this can provide fertile ground for a spiral into a tailspin of misinformation and conspiracy theories. This means that the red/blue pill debate is blurring, and is today threatening to transform into a uniform purple pill of bias and distrust.Ciaran O'Connor, of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, says this is underpinned by confirmation bias, our tendency to prioritise or remember new information that supports our pre-existing opinions. ""Platforms such as Facebook are designed to profit from engagement and time spent on their platforms - and one way platforms engineer this is through algorithms. But we've seen how algorithms can inadvertently direct people to spaces where they are exposed and incentivised to engage in conspiracy content,"" he said.He points to the evolution of the QAnon conspiracy as one of the best examples of this in action.  Its momentum eventually snowballed into January's US Capitol riots, fuelled in part by former President Trump's false claims of widespread election interference. Despite intensified efforts to ban QAnon content on YouTube, Facebook and elsewhere, the once niche online conspiracy had already ""gone global"", says Mr O'Connor.  The irony is that although conspiracy theory followers believe they are emulating Neo by following the white rabbit and ""unplugging"" in search of truth, in fact the opposite is happening - they are being distracted within the very system they think they are exposing.  However, digital information sharing has not solely reinforced mistruth and protected the establishment. The original WikiLeaks data dump and Edward Snowden's mass surveillance revelations, while controversial in their practice, uncovered widespread government wrongdoing. Social media has equally shown it can act as a liberating, uniting force, empowering democratic coups and social justice initiatives.Beyond shifting perceptions of truth, our increasingly interconnected online presence, known as a digital footprint, realises elements of the original Matrix film in ways that felt pure science fiction at the time of release.Our willingness, tacitly or otherwise, to share personal information and agree to monitoring via technology, from mobile phones apps to machine learning tools like smart speakers, has allowed a very detailed picture of our personal lives and habits to be generated.The Cambridge Analytica data scandal showed how this information can be used to target, influence, and potentially swing voters in political systems.Elsewhere, the overlap between our digital and real life profiles has been increased by augmented reality and virtual reality, which mirror the way the rebels in the original film plug in and out of the simulation. Facebook recently announced long-term plans to create a virtual metaverse - allowing more of life to be lived out immersively online. By the same token, the way Morpheus's freedom fighters hack the matrix system to install programmes, scenarios or different appearances reflects today's real-world rise of deepfake videos - a computer-generated copy that aims to impersonate someone. Transhumanism, the belief that humans can improve beyond their physical and mental limitations and ""upgrade"" their bodies by incorporating technology, also matches the way characters in the film can download skillsets and learn to manipulate physics laws within the simulation. The film's nod to identity and the body as malleable has been strengthened by Lilly Wachowski, who retrospectively described it as a trans allegory when speaking to Netflix last year.""That was the original intention but the corporate world wasn't quite ready,"" said the filmmaker, who came out as trans along with her sister Lana after the original trilogy was released.     So where does all this leave The Matrix as we look to the future?Some believe full-circle. In 2016, a group of physicists suggested it is likely that our universe is not real and is instead a giant simulation run by a higher power. Technologists in Silicon Valley, including Tesla boss Elon Musk, have supported the idea.As implausible as it sounds, it fits the legacy of The Matrix. As Neo warned the machines in 1999: ""I'm going to show them a world without you, a world without rules and controls, without borders and boundariesâ¦ a world where anything is possible"".Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Trump sues NY attorney to block company inquiry,"Donald Trump has sued New York state Attorney General Letitia James, seeking to block her from continuing to investigate his company.The former US president argues she has violated his constitutional rights by pursuing a politically-motivated probe.Ms James says the investigation ""will continue undeterred"".She opened a civil inquiry in 2019 into claims that - before he took office - Mr Trump had inflated the value of his assets to banks when seeking loans. The lawsuit comes less that two weeks after Ms James indicated that Mr Trump could be questioned under oath next month as part of the inquiry.Mr Trump is also suspected of understating his assets to lower his taxes.Ms James' office has been seeking documents on four Trump Organization properties in Manhattan, upstate New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.In May, Ms James, a Democrat, told the BBC that her team had ""informed the Trump Organization that our investigation into the Organization is no longer purely civil in nature"".The former president, who is a Republican, has described the inquiry as a witch hunt.Throughout his presidency from 2017 to 2021, Mr Trump resolutely refused to reveal his tax returns, despite coming under great pressure to do so.Civil cases usually have to do with injury to individuals or other private parties, including businesses; criminal law applies in cases where the damage is thought to affect society at large, including the state.",0.033
Trump ex-chief of staff in contempt of Congress,"The US House of Representatives has voted to hold ex-Trump Chief of Staff Mark Meadows in contempt of Congress, paving the way for prosecution. Last week, Mr Meadows said he would stop co-operating with a congressional panel investigating the 6 January riot at the US Capitol. The vote largely fell along party lines, with the Democrat-run chamber voting 222 in favour and 208 against. He could face up to a year in prison and a $100,000 (Â£75,631) fine. Mr Meadows will now be referred to the Justice Department, which will ultimately decide whether to formally charge him. Trump supporters breached the US Congress building on 6 January as lawmakers were meeting to certify the election result.Before last week, Mr Meadows had provided the committee about 9,000 pages of records regarding the events, before reversing course and claiming that his communications are protected by executive privilege - a legal principle designed to shield certain White House records. After Mr Meadows twice refused to appear at scheduled depositions, on Monday the congressional panel voted unanimously to recommend that the House hold him in contempt. ""Mr Meadows started by doing the right thing - co-operating. He handed over records that he didn't try to shield behind some excuse,"" said Representative Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the 6 January committee. ""When these records raise questions - as these most certainly do - you have to come in and answer those questions,"" Mr Thompson added. ""He changed his mind and told us to pound sand. He didn't even show up."" On Monday, the committee released messages sent to Mr Meadows while the riot was underway, revealing that key Trump administration officials and allies were concerned about what was happening. Among those who contacted Mr Meadows was Donald Trump Jr, who wrote ""he's [the president] has got to condemn this"" as soon as possible.Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, a vocal defender of Mr Trump, took to the House floor ahead of the vote to decry the measure. ""Mark Meadows is our former colleague,"" Mr Jordan told lawmakers. ""He is a good man, and he is my friend. And this, this is as wrong as it gets.""With the vote, Mr Meadows becomes the second Trump-era official to be referred to the justice department to face charges, following strategist Steve Bannon. In November, Mr Bannon was formally charged. Separately on Tuesday, Washington DC officials said they would sue the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, two groups that were heavily involved with the Capitol riot.The civil suit seeks to recoup funds they say were spent defending the city and federal buildings from the pro-Trump mob.",0.089
Trump’s son urged him to intervene in Capitol riot,"Donald Trump's son sent the White House chief-of-staff frantic texts calling for his father to intervene during the Capitol riot on 6 January.A committee investigating the violence was shown messages from Donald Trump Jr to Mark Meadows, saying the deadly riot had ""gotten out of hand"".He was one of several senior political and media figures who texted Mr Meadows with their concerns.The president was criticised for not intervening early on in the riot.He did eventually urge his supporters to ""go home"", but not before the pro-Trump mob had stormed the Capitol building, where Congress were meeting to certify Joe Biden's presidential election win. In the newly-revealed messages to Mr Meadows, Mr Trump Jr used strong terms to suggest his father should act.""He's got to condemn this shit ASAP,"" the younger Trump wrote, according to US lawmaker Liz Cheney, vice-chair of the committee investigating if the former president had foreknowledge of the riot.The former president has repeatedly denied suggestions that he encouraged his supporters to act violently.The messages had been submitted by Mr Meadows, who faces criminal contempt charges for refusing to comply with the committee's inquiry.""As the violence continued, one of the President's sons texted Mr Meadows,"" said Ms Cheney, the Republican lawmaker representing the state of Wyoming, told the Select Committee on Monday. She said Mr Meadows responded to Mr Trump Jr's plea by writing back: ""I'm pushing it hard. I agree.""""Still, President Trump did not immediately act,"" Ms Cheney said, and ""Donald Trump Jr texted again and again"".""Quote, 'We need an Oval office address. He [ex-President Trump] has to lead now. It has gone too far and gotten out of hand,' end quote.""On Monday, it was also revealed that at around the same time several leading hosts of the Fox News TV channel - which is widely seen as being sympathetic to Donald Trump and the Republican party - were also urging Mr Meadows to get the then-president to stop the rioting. ""Mark, president needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home. This is hurting all of us. He is destroying his legacy,"" according to a text message by Laura Ingraham. Meanwhile, Brian Kilmeade, another Fox News star, wrote: ""Please get him [ex-President Trump] on TV. Destroying everything you have accomplished.""Summing up the submitted messages, Ms Cheney said: ""These texts leave no doubt. The White House knew exactly what was happening at the Capitol.""Former President Trump, his son, and the two Fox News hosts have not publicly commented on the latest developments.On Tuesday, Washington DC officials said they would sue the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, two groups that were heavily involved with the Capitol riot. The civil suit seeks to recoup funds that they say were spent defending the city and federal buildings from the pro-Trump mob. ",0.075
Trump uses expletive to attack ex-ally Netanyahu,"Former US President Donald Trump has launched a scathing attack on his once-close ally, ex-Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing him of disloyalty.Mr Trump said he was furious at Mr Netanyahu for the way he congratulated Joe Biden on his election victory, using an expletive towards him.He also said he believed he saved Israel from destruction.Mr Trump made the comments in interviews for a book about his role in Middle East peace-making.The US administration under Mr Trump, from 2017-2021, is considered the most favourable towards Israel in the two countries' history. Mr Netanyahu served as Israeli prime minister while Mr Trump was in office, and the two men were portrayed as having particularly warm personal relations, often publicly praising one another.Speaking to Israeli journalist Barak Ravid for his book Trump's peace: The Abraham Accords and the Reshaping of the Middle East, Mr Trump accused Mr Netanyahu of congratulating too quickly Mr Trump's successor Joe Biden on winning the 2020 US election. Mr Trump disputed the election result, though his claims were never upheld.""The first person who congratulated [Joe Biden] was Bibi [Benjamin] Netanyahu, the man that I did more for than any other person I dealt withâ¦ Bibi could have stayed quiet. He has made a terrible mistake.""He was very early,"" Mr Trump said. ""Like earlier than most. I haven't spoken to him since. [Expletive] him.In actual fact, Mr Netanyahu was not the first foreign leader to congratulate Mr Biden. He also tweeted his gratitude towards Mr Trump minutes later.In other comments, Mr Trump says: ""Nobody did more for Bibi. And I liked Bibi,"" adding: ""I still like Bibi. But I also like loyalty.""Mr Netanyahu was ousted from office in June this year after failing to form a government following deadlocked elections.In the interviews given in April and July, Mr Trump also expresses his belief that he saved Israel from destruction.""I'll tell you what - had I not come along, I think Israel was going to be destroyed. OK. You want to know the truth? I think Israel would have been destroyed maybe by now.""In response to Mr Trump's comments, Mr Netanyahu told Axios: ""I highly appreciate President Trump's big contribution to Israel and its security. I also appreciate the importance of the strong alliance between Israel and the US and therefore it was important for me to congratulate the incoming president.""As US president, Mr Trump took a series of steps in support of Mr Netanyahu, including controversially recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, sparking fury across the Arab world. Israel has occupied East Jerusalem - claimed by the Palestinians as the capital of their own hoped-for state - since 1967.Mr Trump also declared Israeli settlements in occupied territory were not illegal, putting the US out of step with the UN, and recognised Israeli sovereignty over the Syrian Golan Heights, also occupied by Israel since 1967. Mr Netanyahu unveiled a planned settlement there called Trump Heights in return.",0.121
US court rejects Trump's request to block files,"A US appeals court has rejected a bid by former President Donald Trump to block Capitol riot investigators from accessing his White House records.Mr Trump, a Republican, has argued that his past communications are protected by executive privilege, under which presidential files can be kept secret. But President Joe Biden has waived executive privilege on the documents.Lawmakers are trying to find out if Mr Trump had foreknowledge of the riot, which took place on 6 January.Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building as Congress was meeting to certify Joe Biden's presidential election result.Mr Trump has refused to acknowledge losing the election to Mr Biden last year, making claims - without evidence - of mass voter fraud. He is expected to appeal against Thursday's decision, which will then be passed to the Supreme Court.Announcing their ruling, three judges from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the former president had provided ""no basis"" for them to grant his request to override Mr Biden's judgment. They said both branches of government agreed that there was a unique legislative need for the records, which were directly relevant to the attack. The inquiry is being conducted by a committee set up by the House of Representatives, which is dominated by President Biden's Democrats.The panel wants to see phone records, visitor logs and other White House documents that could shed light on events leading up to the attack on Congress.Mr Trump's lawyers had said in an earlier filing to the appeals court that their client could ""suffer irreparable harm through the effective denial of a constitutional and statutory right to be fully heard on a serious disagreement between the former and incumbent president"".Following the Capitol riot, Mr Trump was impeached by the lower house of Congress, but cleared by the then Republican-dominated upper house - the Senate - of inciting an insurrection. More than 670 people have been arrested for the invasion of the Capitol complex.",0.071
Lawmakers to hold Trump chief of staff in contempt,"US lawmakers investigating the January Capitol riot say they will hold former Trump chief of staff, Mark Meadows, in criminal contempt.The House Select Committee said it had ""no choice"" but to seek charges over his refusal to comply with its inquiry.Mr Meadows had previously provided the bipartisan panel with information, but said this week he would not co-operate.On Wednesday, he sued the committee members, seeking to nullify subpoenas they issued.The suit alleges that ""overly broad and unduly burdensome"" subpoenas sent to Mr Meadows violate legal protections for senior advisors to a president, and charge the committee with using excessively broad subpoenas to obtain his phone records.Mr Meadows will be the third ex-Trump aide to be held in contempt by the panel.In a letter sent to Mr Meadows on Tuesday, committee chairman Bennie G Thompson objected to Mr Meadows' argument that the information lawmakers wanted from him was protected by executive privilege - a legal principle that protects many White House communications from being shared. ""There is no legitimate legal basis for Mr Meadows to refuse to cooperate with the Select Committee,"" wrote Mr Thompson, who is a Democratic representative for Mississippi.Mr Meadows had said initially he would appear before the House panel this week, and had already provided the committee with some 6,000 pages worth of documents, including messages from his personal phone. In one exchange from 6 November 2020, Mr Meadows discussed appointing alternate electors (people who cast the official votes for president) in certain states, which effectively undermined some of the presidential election results. ""I love it,"" Mr Meadows wrote in a message to a Congress member. Also included in the text messages is an exchange ""between Meadows and an organiser of the January 6th rally"", Mr Thompson wrote. But after the committee said they would file formal criminal contempt charges, Mr Meadows filed a lawsuit against Mr Thompson, Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and the panel of seven Democrats and two Republicans. Mr Meadows' about-face comes during the release of his memoir, which includes revelations about his former boss, particularly about the time Mr Trump had Covid-19. The disclosures have reportedly angered the former president. In his book, Mr Meadows wrote that Mr Trump was ""mortified"" by the events of 6 January. Donald Trump had urged his former aides to reject any requests to testify in front of the House panel, claiming executive privilege exempts them from cooperation. The House committee will next vote to hold Mr Meadows in contempt. If the House of Representatives upholds with charge, the case will be referred to the Justice department, which has the final say on bringing charges. ",0.077
Wall Street watchdogs probe Trump media firm deal,"Donald Trump's deal to float his social media firm on the stock market is being investigated by Wall Street watchdogs.Regulators are probing Digital World Acquisition Corp, the firm set to merge with Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG).  According to a filing on Monday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requested documents about its investors and trading.TMTG plans to launch a social media app called Truth Social early next year. The filing states that the SEC also asked to see information detailing the relationship between Digital World and TMTG.It also said that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is probing the deal as well.The SEC told the BBC it does not comment on the ""existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation"". The BBC has contacted TMTG for comment.The SEC was requested by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren last month, to investigate the proposed merger of the two firms for potential violations of securities laws. Digital World is a so-called special purpose acquisition company (Spac) or ""blank cheque company"". Spacs, which became a major story in the US stock market at the start of this year, are shell companies that are set up with the sole purpose of merging with a private firm to take it public. However, they have lost much of their lustre after some of the companies that merged with them failed to deliver on their ambitious financial projections.On Saturday, Mr Trump's firm said it had secured $1bn from ""a diverse group of institutional investors"" without revealing who they were. According to reports, the social media venture is now valued at almost $4bn. The former US president is still banned from Twitter and Facebook following the 6 January attack on the US Capitol.At the time he was banned Mr Trump had 89 million followers on Twitter, 33 million on Facebook and 24.5 million on Instagram, according to a presentation on his company's website.",0.057
Trump social media firm says it has raised $1bn,"Donald Trump's new social media firm says it has entered into agreements to raise $1bn (Â£755m) from investors ahead of a planned stock market listing.The Trump Media & Technology Group is working to launch a social media app called Truth Social early next year. It comes as Mr Trump remains banned from Twitter and Facebook following the attack on the US Capitol in January.""$1bn sends an important message to Big Tech that censorship and political discrimination must end,"" he said. ""As our balance sheet expands, Trump Media & Technology Group will be in a stronger position to fight back against the tyranny of Big Tech.""Mr Trump announced plans to launch Truth Social earlier this year, saying it would allow conversation ""without discrimination on the basis of political ideology"".The Trump Media & Technology Group has partnered on the project with Digital World Acquisition, a so called special purpose acquisition company (Spac) or ""blank cheque company"". Spacs, which became a major story in the US stock market at the start of this year, are shell companies that are set up with the sole purpose of merging with a private firm to take it public. However, they have lost much of their lustre after some of the companies that merged with them failed to deliver on their ambitious financial projections.On Saturday, Mr Trump's firm said it had secured the $1bn from from ""a diverse group of institutional investors"" without revealing who they were. According to reports, the social media venture is now valued at almost $4bn.It would appear to underscore the former US president's ability to attract strong financial backing despite the controversy surrounding his time in charge.Mr Trump was banned from top social media platforms after the 6 January attack by his supporters on the US Capitol in Washington DC amid concerns the then-president would inspire further violence. It came after Mr Trump made claims, without evidence, of widespread fraud in last year's presidential election.Many Wall Street firms snubbed the opportunity to invest in the former president's new venture, according to Reuters. But some hedge funds, family investment firms and high net-worth individuals have backed it.Mr Trump had 89 million followers on Twitter, 33 million on Facebook and 24.5 million on Instagram at the time he was blocked, according to a presentation on his company's website.He has also repeatedly dropped hints that he might seek the presidency again in 2024.However, there have been questions about the state of the former president's finances. Last month a congressional committee found he had ""grossly exaggerated"" the profitability of his Washington DC hotel - claims the Trump Organization called ""misleading"".Trump Media & Technology Group's partnership with Digital World Acquisition has already attracted scrutiny. Last month Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the planned merger for potential violations of securities laws. The SEC has declined to comment on whether it plans any action.Truth Social is scheduled for a full rollout in the first quarter of 2022. It is the first of three stages in the Trump Media plan, followed by a subscription video-on-demand service called TMTG+ that will feature entertainment, news and podcasts, according to the news release.In a slide deck on its website, the company envisions eventually competing against Amazon.com's AWS cloud service and Google Cloud.",0.084
Rights groups condemn Trump migrant policy return,"US human rights groups have criticised the reinstatement of a Trump-era policy requiring asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while claims are processed. The American Immigration Council said it was a dark day for the US and the rule of law.US President Joe Biden had suspended the policy, calling it ""inhumane"", but was ordered by courts to resume it.Under the policy, thousands of migrants were forced to stay in dangerous conditions on the Mexican border.  But Republicans have welcomed the decision as a way to restore order in the border regions.Mexico has now agreed to accept the policy, known as Remain in Mexico, in exchange for concessions such as a shorter turnaround time for asylum decisions and a US-Mexico development programme for Central America.Mr Biden's administration has kept up one other major Trump-era border policy: Title 42, which allows for the quick expulsion of migrants on public health grounds.Former US President Donald Trump introduced the programme, then known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, to send more than 60,000 asylum applicants back to Mexico. Migrants were often left waiting in Mexico for months, where they sometimes fell prey to criminal gangs. According to charity Human Rights First, there have been more than 1,500 publicly reported cases of kidnapping, rape, torture and other abuses against migrants returned to Mexico.Mr Biden suspended the programme almost immediately after taking office, as part of a campaign pledge to reverse hardline immigration policies enacted by his predecessor. In June, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas terminated the policy.But in August, a federal court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, ruled that the policy had been improperly cancelled.The Biden administration is appealing against the decision. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Thursday that the president stood by past remarks about the ""unjustified human costs"" of the programme.""But we also believe in following the law,"" she said.The policy has been revamped to address Mexico's concerns, including to limit time spent for each asylum application to six months. Implementation is expected to begin next week at ports of entry in Texas and California. Immigration has again proven to be the main prism through which Washington views its relationship with Mexico. Â It seems the numbers of people arriving at the US southern border - and the effect that is having on President Biden's standing in the polls - has meant the administration is happy enough to reinstate the law - albeit having been ordered to do so by the courts. Yet one might well as ask what Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has to gain by agreeing to carry out his side of the policy, namely accepting thousands of asylum-seekers into Mexican border towns to await their day in a US court. On the surface, he has added a more humanitarian veneer to the policy, tying down a timeline of 180 days in which asylum cases should be heard and development funds for Central America under the name ""Planting Opportunities"". But in reality, this is a political risk he can afford to take. Â With asylum seekers likely to be living again in precarious conditions in dangerous border towns, the Mexican president may be considering that migrants will have less incentive to travel north. And in the meantime, he has undoubtedly created some useful leverage with President Biden in other areas. The move was condemned by pro-immigration groups and lawmakers from Mr Biden's own Democratic party. In a statement, American Immigration Council policy director Jorge Loweree rejected the Biden team's ""claims that it can administer the Remain in Mexico program in a more humane manner"", adding: ""Today is a dark day for the United States and for the rule of law.""By expanding the programme to include any migrants from the western hemisphere - including non-Spanish speaking groups such as Haitians - Mr Biden had ""made the programme even broader than under Trump"", the group said.The UNHCR, the United Nations refugee agency, also condemned the move and refused to help implement the policy. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said the resumption would lead to ""horrific abuse, including torture, rape, and death"".But Republican House Leader Kevin McCarthy welcomed the programme's reinstatement.""It is unfortunate that it took litigation to force the Biden administration's hand to apply this common-sense measure,"" he said.Texas attorney-general Ken Paxton, a conservative Republican, described the development as a ""huge win"".""I will continue to fight to restore safety and order along our southern border, making sure that this essential programme is implemented in full compliance with the court's order,"" he said, quoted by the Associated Press.But Texas Democratic Congresswoman Veronica Escobar told The Hill newspaper that the policy ""erodes our values as a country"" and is ""a violation of asylum processing"".She called for the White House to aggressively fight the order in court, and criticised Mr Biden for not having fixed the system after nearly a year in office. Democratic Senator Bob Menendez urged Mr Biden to ""make every effort"" to overturn ""this xenophobic and anti-immigrant policy for good"".",0.1
US and Mexico to restart 'Remain in Mexico' policy,"Would-be asylum seekers who cross the US southern border will be sent to Mexico to await claims decisions following the restart of a controversial programme.The US and Mexican governments said Thursday that they will reinstate the Trump-era policy known as Remain in Mexico.US President Joe Biden had suspended the programme, calling it ""inhumane"".A court order forced a reversal, however.Former President Donald Trump used the programme, then known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, to send more than 60,000 asylum applicants back to Mexico. Migrants were often left waiting in Mexico for months, where they sometimes fell prey to criminal gangs. According to charity Human Rights First, there have been more than 1,500 publicly reported cases of kidnapping, rape, torture and other crimes against migrants returned to Mexico.Mr Biden, a Democrat, had suspended the programme almost immediately after taking office, as part of a campaign pledge to reverse hardline immigration policies enacted by his predecessor. In June, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas terminated the policy.The programme's resurrection follows an August ruling by federal court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, who found that the Biden administration had improperly cancelled the policy earlier this year.Asked about the resumption of the policy on Thursday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that both Mr Biden and Mr Mayorkas stand by previous statements describing the programme as one with ""endemic flaws"" with ""unjustified human costs"".""But we also believe in following the law,"" she said.The revived policy includes new steps to address Mexico's human rights concerns about the policy - reportedly a caveat for their participation. Under guidance from Mexico, the US will now include providing Covid-19 vaccinations for migrants, and expanded exemptions, such as for those with physical and mental health challenges. Also at Mexico's request, the US agreed to limit time spent to six months for each asylum applicant. The Mexican government said it was committed to maintaining the health and safety of migrants. The administration is appealing Judge Kacsmaryk's order, but was legally required to enforce the ruling. Judge Kacsmaryk acknowledged that the policy could only be implemented with Mexico's consent, prompting a months-long negotiation between the two countries. Implementation is expected to begin next week, first in El Paso and Brownsville, Texas, as well as San Diego, California. The move was slammed by the pro-immigration Washington-DC based American Immigration Council.""We categorically reject the Biden administration's claims that it can administer the Remain in Mexico program in a more humane manner,"" the group said in a statement, adding: ""Today is a dark day for the United States and for the rule of law.""They added that by expanding the programme to include any migrants from the Western Hemisphere - including non-Spanish speaking groups such as Haitians - Mr Biden ""made the programme even broader than under Trump"".",0.042
Former Pentagon chief Mark Esper sues Pentagon,"Former Pentagon chief Mark Esper has sued the Pentagon over redactions to his forthcoming memoir.In a lawsuit filed on Sunday, Mr Esper accuses the defence department of censoring portions of his manuscript ""under the guise of classification"".He was ""disappointed"" to have his right to free speech violated, he said.Mr Esper was appointed defence secretary in 2019 by former president Donald Trump, who fired him shortly after the November 2020 election. His book, due to be released in May 2022, is an ""unvarnished and candid memoir"" of his time at the White House, according to the lawsuit filed in Washington, DC.It accuses the agency that he led for 18 months of ""arbitrarily"" editing out the text of A Sacred Oath that Mr Esper said was ""crucial to telling important stories discussed in the manuscript"". ""No written explanation was offered to justify the deletions"" and the Pentagon could not confirm that the redacted text contained classified information, the lawsuit said.Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said: ""As with all such reviews, the department takes seriously its obligation to balance national security with an author's narrative desire.""Rules require former defence officials to submit book manuscripts to the department to ensure that no state secrets are divulged. The lawsuit called Mr Esper's time as Secretary of Defense one of ""unprecedented"" civil unrest, public health crises, growing threats abroad, and Pentagon transformation , with ""a White House seemingly bent on circumventing the Constitution"". Mr Trump fired his defence chief on 9 November, 2020, shortly after losing the general election to Joe Biden, writing in a tweet that the Gulf War veteran had been ""terminated"" from the top Pentagon job.According to a new book by an ABC correspondent, reasons included Mr Esper's decision to bar Confederate flags from military bases, his public opposition to Mr Trump's desire to use American military forces to put down racial justice riots, and Mr Esper's focus on threats from Russia.Previously, the Trump administration sought to stop the publication of a memoir written by John Bolton, the former president's National Security Advisor, but failed.Mr Esper said: ""I am more than disappointed the current administration is infringing on my First Amendment constitutional rights"".",0.056
Bid to uncover Trump golf course finances fails,"A legal bid to force Holyrood to investigate how Donald Trump paid for two Scottish golf courses has failed. Lawyers for human rights organisation AVAAZ argued ministers were wrong not to pursue an unexplained wealth order probe against the former US PresidentIt wanted a probe into the financing of the Menie golf course in Aberdeenshire and the Turnberry resort in Ayrshire. At the Court of Session Lord Sandison found that ministers had acted lawfully and in line with legislation. In a written judgment issued on Thursday, he rejected the arguments made by the New York-based human rights group. The Scottish Green Party first called for an unexplained wealth order amid questions about how Mr Trump had managed to finance the purchases of the courses at Turnberry in 2014 and at Menie in Aberdeenshire, in 2006.The UK government introduced the orders to help investigations into money laundering and other criminal financial activity. Patrick Harvie, the Greens co-leader, has said Trump's unusual pattern of spending and the ongoing civil and criminal cases in the US provided Scottish authorities with the grounds to investigate the businessman. But Mr Trump's son Eric Trump warned that the move could deter overseas investors.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament that the responsibility for the investigation lay with the Crown Office's Civil Recovery Unit - which was politically independent from the government. The then Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf later announced that Ms Sturgeon was mistaken - and that the law did allow for the Scottish government to launch an unexplained wealth order investigation. This prompted AVAAZ to instruct lawyers to go to the Court of Session.In October 2021, Aidan O'Neill QC said that by looking at the legislation, the court would see that it is the Scottish ministers and not Scotland's most senior prosecutor, the Lord Advocate, who are responsible for ordering an unexplained wealth order investigation. He added: ""We say that duty results in ultimately the finding that it cannot be the Lord Advocate who is designated as being the responsible minister in terms of the seeking of unexplained wealth orders in terms of politically exposed persons.""The Scottish Ministers contested the action and its legal team told the court that it had acted lawfully in the affair. Lord Sandison agreed with the submissions made to him by the government's lawyers. He wrote: ""I shall repel the petitioner's pleas in law, sustain the respondents' second plea in law, and refuse the substantive prayers of the petition.""",0.086
Who is US teen cleared of protest killings?,"A US teenager has been cleared of all charges in relation to two men he shot and killed during unrest in Wisconsin. What do we know about Kyle Rittenhouse?After a black man, Jacob Blake, was shot seven times in the back by a police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August 2020, two nights of rioting erupted.On the third night, 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse fired on three men with a military-style semi-automatic rifle, killing two and seriously injuring a third.He was arrested at his mother's home in Antioch, Illinois, some 30 minutes from Kenosha. A day later he was charged with one count of first-degree intentional homicide and one count of first-degree reckless homicide.Videos indicate he spent hours on Tuesday apparently helping patrol the streets. He told journalists it was his ""job"" to guard buildings and even offer medical assistance to protesters.Before dropping out of high school, he participated in cadet programmes with the fire department and police.His social media profiles show his support for law enforcement.A Facebook photo of him was framed with the ""Blue Lives Matter"" logo - a pro-police movement that has occasionally clashed with Black Lives Matter supporters.Several of his posts honoured police officers killed on duty, and he also posted pictures of himself wearing full police uniform. He is a former member of a local police cadet programme, Grayslake Police Department says.Guns are another of his passions. Photos show him posing with weapons, practising target shooting and assembling a rifle. After leaving school, he had a few jobs including one as a lifeguard.When the protests over Jacob Blake's shooting became violent, Mr Rittenhouse travelled to the city and armed himself with a semi-automatic rifle, with the intention of protecting property, he said.In an interview on the night before the shootings, he echoes police language when telling a journalist why he is armed. ""Part of my job also is to protect people. If someone is hurt, I'm running into harm's way,"" he says.He was captured on video at different times during that night. At one point, he speaks to police who offer him water. Later, he was shown being pursued by a group of people, one of whom appeared to fire into the air. The teenager turns to see where the sound is coming from as another person tries to attack him. At that point, the teenager appears to shoot the man, later identified as Joseph Rosenbaum. He was unarmed but Mr Rittenhouse said in court that he had tried to grab his gun, testimony corroborated by one of the prosecution's own witnesses.Fleeing momentarily, he finds himself chased by a crowd who had seen him shoot Rosenbaum, before falling to the ground, and firing his gun. One of those hit by the gunfire falls to the ground, fatally injured. He is later named as Anthony Huber. Huber was seen on video swinging his skateboard at Rittenhouse.Another person runs away apparently injured. In court, Gaige Grosskreutz acknowledged confronting Rittenhouse with a gun, even pointing it at him, but he denied he ever intended to shoot him. One of the charges brought against him was possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18. It was later dropped when his lawyers successfully argued state law allowed for someone under 18 to possess the firearm.Correction 9th October 2020: This article was amended in the hours after publication to give a more detailed account of the sequence of events and make clear that Kyle Rittenhouse was seen on video being pursued by a group of people before the first shooting.",0.031
What are Biden's challenges at the border?,"US President Joe Biden entered the White House promising to tackle immigration challenges that have remained unsolved for decades.Yet since he took office in January, the US has seen a record influx of migrants at its southern border, prompting criticism of the administration's policies from across the political spectrum.Some two million ""encounters"" between government agents and migrants near the border are expected by the end of 2021, Mr Biden's Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has said.About 125,000 unaccompanied minors have already been taken into the government's care.Mr Mayorkas told US senators in November that the US immigration system was ""broken"". Will things get worse before they get better?Here's what we know about the situation.While the number of migrants at the border has been steadily increasing since April 2020, the numbers spiked sharply after Mr Biden took office.Economic problems in Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Cuba worsened during the pandemic, forcing some to take on a long and perilous journey north. Gangs and violence have also been given as reasons why some left home.Mr Biden's plan to offer legal status to an estimated 11 million undocumented people in the US - that proposal has been watered down by the president's fellow Democrats in the House of Representatives and looks likely to be rejected outright in the Senate - is also blamed by conservatives for encouraging migrants.Though he has avoided Mr Trump's rhetoric, Mr Biden has repeatedly called on migrants, including asylum seekers, not to attempt the journey to the US.Despite a slight decline in September, the number of migrant encounters still represented about a 33% increase from the 144,000 recorded in May 2019 - the highest total of the Trump administration.There's also been a sharp increase in the number of children crossing the border. Migrants cross the border in one of two ways. Those who believe they ""have suffered persecution or fear that they will suffer persecution"" in their home country are eligible to apply for asylum when they present themselves at a port of entry for admission into the US.Others may evade border officials by hiding in cars or travelling undetected across unprotected - and often treacherous - parts of the US-Mexico border.According to the Pew Research Center, at least 40% of unauthorised migrants in the country entered legally on short-term visas and overstayed.On Covid, Mr Biden kept a Trump-era emergency policy to automatically expel almost all undocumented migrants seeking entry, bypassing normal immigration laws and protections.The policy - known as Title 42 - is aimed at preventing the spread of Covid-19 in holding facilities, officials say.The measure sparked controversy in September when the Biden administration used Title 42 to deport nearly 4,000 Haitian migrants who had been detained at the border city of Del Rio, Texas.The Biden administration has defended the Trump-era policy in courts, where civil rights groups have argued that it violates existing US asylum laws. Politicians from Mr Biden's own Democratic party have also spoken out against the policy.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in August that the policy will remain in effect until the spread of Covid by non-citizens stops being a ""serious danger"" to public health.It plans to review the situation every 60 days.In contrast to Mr Trump, however, Mr Biden has decided not to refuse entry to unaccompanied minors and some families.One of the most substantive changes in border policy under Mr Biden has been a shift in how the government deals with migrant families.A so-called ""zero-tolerance"" policy under Mr Trump meant families divided by US authorities, in some cases with parents being deported back to their home countries without their children. Mr Biden has reversed that specific practice, and some families - but not all - have been reunited.A task force set up by the president estimated that 3,913 children had been separated from their parents. As of September, authorities were still trying to reach the parents of 303 children separated from their families, according to a court filing.As mandated by US anti-trafficking laws, Mr Biden's administration has been transferring non-Mexican minors to shelters overseen by the government.Critics of the administration previously suggested that holding children in those facilities harkened back to a Trump-era policy, though children were being held for less time under Mr Biden. In May, the number of children held in detention facilities declined by nearly 90% after they were transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for temporary resettlement. On Mr Biden's first day in office, his administration suspended a controversial Trump-era policy that forced asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their US immigration hearings.Since it was introduced in January 2019, about 70,000 migrants were enrolled in the programme informally known as Remain in Mexico.After Mr Biden took office, the initiative quickly became the focus of intense legal wrangling.While the policy - which Mr Biden had previously called ""inhumane"" - was terminated in June, an August ruling by Trump-appointed federal court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk found that the administration had improperly cancelled the policy.As a result, the US and Mexican governments said on 2 December that they would reinstate the policy and send would-be asylum seekers to Mexico to await claims decisions.At a news conference following the announcement, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the administration stood by its opposition to the policy. She added that the programme has ""endemic flaws"" with ""unjustified human costs"".""But we also believe in following the law,"" Ms Psaki said.The White House, however, said several new steps would be taken to address concerns, including providing Covid-19 vaccinations for migrants and a six-month time limit for each asylum advocate.Implementation of the re-instated policy was scheduled to begin the week of 6 December, beginning in El Paso and Brownsville, Texas and San Diego, California.Mr Biden signed an order on his first day in office to pause all wall construction and to end the national emergency declaration on the southern border.He later ordered that military funds Mr Trump had tapped for the project be diverted, leading to a Republican-requested inquiry into whether Mr Biden had inappropriately re-directed congressionally approved funds. Property owners near the border have complained that despite the pause, the government is still seeking to seize borderlands for future construction using a process known as eminent domain.Dozens of eminent domain cases brought by the federal government remain open and could take years for the courts to decide.Some wall construction sites remain abruptly abandoned, with building materials strewn about, as construction had continued right up until the moment of Mr Biden's order to halt. On 27 September, the US Department of State announced that the government plans to increase the number of refugees allowed into the US to 125,000 for the fiscal year that began on 1 October.With the move, Mr Biden fulfilled one of his campaign promises. During his presidential bid, Mr Biden repeatedly criticised Mr Trump's decision to set the annual refugee cap at 15,000 - a historic low. Mr Biden had stunned his supporters in April by announcing plans to only allow 15,000 refugees into the US in 2021. The annual refugee cap was set by Mr Trump the year before. Following intense public backlash, he raised the number to 62,500 refugees. About 110,000 refugees were admitted to the US in the last year of President Barack Obama's final term.Mr Biden also called for more refugees to come from Africa, the Middle East and Central America, and for an end to restrictions on resettlements from Somalia, Syria and Yemen.",0.04
Trump ally Bannon defiant after surrender to FBI,"Trump ally Steve Bannon has lashed out at the Biden administration as he surrendered to the FBI to face charges over his refusal to co-operate with the congressional Capitol riot inquiry.""This is going to be the misdemeanour from hell,"" the former strategist said outside the FBI's Washington office. Mr Bannon, 67, faces up to a year in prison and a $100,000 (Â£75,000) fine if convicted.He was formally charged on Friday in the case. Mr Bannon is accused of defying a summons to testify on what he knew about plans for the protest that ended with Trump supporters storming Congress.Supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the Congress building on 6 January as results of the 2020 election were being certified inside.Mr Trump, a Republican, has refused to acknowledge losing the election to Democratic President Joe Biden last year, making claims - without evidence - of mass voter fraud.Mr Bannon was indicted on one count of refusing to appear for a deposition and one count of refusing to provide subpoenaed documents to a committee investigating the riot. Appearing outside court on Monday afternoon, he said he believed the charges were politically motivated and vowed to fight them. ""We're tired of playing defence. We're going to go on the offense on this,"" he said. As part of restrictions set by the court, Mr Bannon will be required to check in weekly, remain at his listed address and notify authorities of any plans to leave the Washington DC area. He was also required to surrender his passport to authorities. No plea has yet been entered, and a virtual hearing has been scheduled for Thursday morning. Mr Bannon also live-streamed his arrival for his first court appearance, telling followers: ""I want you guys to stay focused, stay on message.""""Remember: Signal not noise. This is all noise, that's signal.""He also urged his supporters to stay focused on taking on what he described as the ""illegitimate Biden regime"".According to subpoena documents, Mr Bannon - who currently hosts the right-wing War Room podcast - said on the eve of the riot that ""all hell is going to break loose tomorrow"".His lawyers have argued that his communications involving the former president are protected.Mr Bannon's is the first such indictment to come out of the House of Representatives Select Committee's inquiry of the 6 January events.Mr Trump has urged former aides to reject deposition requests, arguing that they are covered by executive privilege - a legal principle that protects many White House communications.Another Trump official, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, could also face consequences for defying a similar subpoena to appear before the committee.Dozens of subpoenas were issued last week, calling on former Trump officials to hand over documents and testify about the riot.On Sunday, Mr Trump defended his former aide - whom he fired in 2017, saying: ""This country has perhaps never done to anyone what they have done to Steve Bannon"".",0.054
"Trumps selling Washington hotel, reports say","The Trump Organization has reportedly reached a deal to sell its prized Washington hotel for $375m (Â£279m).Under the planned sale, the Trump International will be renamed the Waldorf Astoria and managed by the Hilton group, according to reports.Last month, a US congressional probe found the hotel lost more than $70m during Donald Trump's presidency.The former US president's company opened the hotel to the public in September 2016.The Trump Organization, which bought a 60-year lease on the building, had been looking for buyers for the 263-room hotel since 2019.The deal with Miami-based investment firm CGI Merchant Group is expected to be finalised in the first quarter of next year, sources told The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg.The 120-year-old building stands less than a mile away from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue.The Trump Organization won approval to redevelop the historic Old Post Office building in 2012.It opened as a hotel four years later, just weeks after Mr Trump accepted the Republican Party's nomination to run for president.During Mr Trump's term as president, the hotel became popular amongst Republicans visiting the city. But it also attracted controversy. In 2018, religious leaders called for its liquor licence to be revoked, claiming its owner was ""not a person of good character"". More recently, a congressional investigation found that Mr Trump had ""grossly exaggerated"" the hotel's profits when he claimed it made $150m during his term.The congressional committee said the hotel had instead lost more than $70m while he was in office.The report also found Mr Trump seemed to have ""concealed potential conflicts of interest"" related to his ownership of the hotel and his roles as its lender and the guarantor of third-party loans.Documents showed that the hotel received $3.7m in payments from foreign governments - enough to cover 7,400 nights at the hotel on an average daily rate, according to the committee.The Trump Organization denied wrongdoing and called the report ""misleading"".The Trump Organization and CGI Merchant Group did not immediately respond to the BBC's requests for comment on the sale of the Trump International Hotel.",0.073
