https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10377929/Mary-Trump-says-uncle-Donald-feeling-walls-close-in.html,"Mary Trump says she thinks her uncle and former President Donald Trump is 'feeling the walls close in' from the Congressional panel investigating the January 6 riot. The niece of the former president spoke with MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell just moments after Representative Liz Cheney told CNN the committee was 'looking at' whether former President Trump's 'action or inaction constituted a crime.'   Mary Trump, 56, then said that her uncle may be waiting for the hammer to fall on him from both the committee and the Department of Justice.  'I don't want to overstate this, because we've seen Donald get away with so much, but even he at this point must be feeling the walls close in,' Mary, who has long been one of her uncle's highest profile critics said: 'If he has any sense, he would feel that way.'She added that she believes the committee is doing 'an extraordinary job of putting the pieces together.' 'There's no doubt in my mind, if they are discussing making such a referral (to prosecutors at the Department of Justice), they have everything nailed down,' she said, reacting to Cheney's announcement.Mary Trump then criticized her uncle's statement addressing the anniversary, in which he accused Democrats of using the occasion to 'stoke fears and divide America,'  'Almost everything Donald says recently is some form of projection or another, which suggests there is some level of knowledge about his own guilt here,' said Mary Trump.Mary also noted that her uncle's decision to cancel a press conference at Mar-a-Lago that had been planned for Thursday was 'significant.'   'It sort of reminds me of the circumstances that led to his video last year that clearly he did not want to make,' she added. 'Somebody managed to convinced him that he had serious legal liability and he did not have a choice, which is why in part I'm guessing he canceled today.'Democrats are ramping up their probe of the January 6th riot, including considering 'Watergate-style' prime-time hearings with a bold-faced witness wish list that includes Mike Pence and Sean Hannity.  In a bid capitalize on the anniversary, Democrats on committee are looking to crank up the pace of their probe and draw a massive audience with prime-time hearings. 'I have favored this strategy from the beginning,' Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, a member of the panel, told MSNBC's Morning Joe on Wednesday. He said he wanted a Watergate-style approach, when the 1973 hearings into Richard Nixon's presidency captivated America. At one point an estimated 85% of the country was tuned in to them.'I remember as a kid getting to watch a bit of the Watergate hearings, which were a daily spectacle that the whole country tuned into,' Raskin said. 'If we can do that for, you know, a break-in in a couple of offices in the Watergate hotel, certainly, we can do it for a massive break-in into the Capitol of the United States, a storming, and a seizure essentially of our government offices, an interruption of the peaceful transfer of power.'Those prime-time hearings could occur in late March or early April, Rep. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, told Bloomberg News.But no date has been set yet. 'We're working toward that,' Thompson said. Those hearings would also feature high-profile witnesses, which would help them gain maximum exposure. Among the names being considered are former Vice President Mike Pence and Fox News host Sean Hannity.Pence was under heavy pressure from then-President Donald Trump to declare the 2020 election results invalid, wipe out Joe Biden's victory and secure him a second term. The vice president has the symbolic role of presiding over the Electoral College certification of results. Pence was a target of the January 6th rioters, some of who threatened to hang him, and was evacuated from the Senate floor as the MAGA supporters stormed the Capitol.Thompson told CNN that he and the panel would like to hear from Pence.'I would hope that he would do the right thing and come forward and voluntarily talk to the committee,' he said.'We have not formally asked. But if he offered, we'd gladly accept. Everything is under consideration,' he added. So far, in its investigation, the committee has interviewed more than 300 witnesses, announced more than 50 subpoenas, obtained more than 35,000 pages of records and received hundreds of telephone tips through their Jan. 6 tipline, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Names are starting to be lined up for hearings. The panel on Tuesday asked longtime Trump supporter Sean Hannity to appear as a 'fact witness' in their investigation, noting how the Fox star was 'expressing concerns and providing advice to the president and White House staff.' The committee released several texts Hannity sent to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.'I'm very worried about the next 48 hours,' Hannity wrote on the eve of January 6th.On January 5, the eve of the Capitol attack, Hannity also texted to Meadows, 'Pence pressure. WH counsel will leave.' In the letter to Hannity, Thompson wrote the texts suggest 'that you had knowledge of concerns by President Trump's White House Counsel's Office regarding the legality of the former President's plans for January 6th.' 'These facts are directly relevant to our inquiry,' Thompson told Hannity. Thompson also said that Hannity appeared to have 'detailed knowledge regarding President Trump's state of mind in the days following the January 6th attack.' One of Hannity's texts indicated he had a discussion with Trump on January 10 and it left the Fox News host concerned in the lead-up to President Joe Biden's January 20 inauguration. 'Guys, we have a clear path to land the plane in 9 days,' Hannity informed Meadows and Republican Rep. Jim Jordan. 'He can't mention the election again. Ever. I did not have a good call with him today. And worse, I'm not sure what is left to do or say, and I don't like not knowing if it's truly understood. Ideas?' On his Fox News show on Tuesday evening, Hannity launched into a stinging rebuke of DC officials and their 'willing accomplices' but didn't mention the letter from the House committee investigating the MAGA riot.'I have an important message to all you elected swamp creatures in Washington, D.C., your willing accomplices, your press secretaries in the media mob,' he began. 'It is frankly repulsive, just repulsive that all of you sycophants, you sit idly by, you say nothing, you do nothing, as Joe Biden completely mismanages COVID-19,' he said.Republicans have not revealed their plans for how they will mark the one-year anniversary of the riot. Donald Trump cancelled a press conference he had scheduled for Thursday.Many Republican lawmakers criticized Trump in the immediate wake of January 6th - some even called him that day to encourage him to try and call off the rioters. But, many of them also have made amends with the former president in the months following particularly as Trump continues to hold a tight grip on Republican base.   ",0.074
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10377085/Nancy-Pelosi-leads-solemn-prayer-vigil-mark-year-anniversary-January-6-Capitol-riot.html,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi led a small group of bicameral lawmakers in a moment of silence for those who died in last year's Capitol riot on Thursday. A day full of reflection and solemn remembrance to mark one year since the deadly January 6 insurrection culminated in a prayer vigil on the Capitol steps. For roughly 10 minutes, what appears to be less than 100 mask-clad members of Congress stood outside holding candles where exactly a year ago, Donald Trump's supporters were overwhelming law enforcement and storming the Capitol, some reportedly hunting for specific lawmakers and other chanting 'Hang Mike Pence.'Alongside Pelosi, top Democrats like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer Majority Whip Sen. Richard Durbin and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer were also in attendance.'On behalf of the distinguished Democratic leader of the Senate, all of our colleagues from the House and Senate, we prayerfully mark one year since the insurrection, and patriotically honor the heroes who defended the Capitol and our democracy that day,' Pelosi began her brief remarks.'Let us all here join in a moment of silence in memory of those who lost their lives and sacrificed so much for our democracy that day.'She was preceded by Bishop Michael Curry, Presiding Bishop over the Episcopal Church, who led lawmakers in a prayer asking for guidance for a 'traumatized' country.'We come before you because we need your help. We need your help in these troubled times. We need your help for this beloved nation,' Curry said.'We need your help for those who have been traumatized and troubled by the painful events of one year ago and all that has continued since.'It's not clear if Rep. Liz Cheney, who was the only sitting Republican lawmaker on the House floor during Pelosi's earlier moment of silence, was in attendance. Cheney and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, were the only GOP politicians who participated in the House's observance today. President Joe Biden tore into former President Donald Trump for watching TV while a mob stormed the Capitol on January 6, mocked his 'bruised ego' and accused him and his supporters of holding a 'dagger in the throat of democracy' in a speech on Thursday.In his most searing attack on his predecessor to date, Biden called Trump a 'defeated former president' and criticized him for 'refusing to accept he lost' the November 2020 in remarks on the one-year anniversary of the attack alongside Kamala Harris.'We saw with our own eyes rioters menace these halls, threatening the life of the Speaker of the House. Literally erecting gallows to hang the vice president of the United States of America,' Biden recalled. 'What did we not see? We didn't see a former president, who just rallied the mob to attack, sitting in a private dining room off the Oval Office in the White House watching it all on television and doing nothing for hours.'    Biden went after the MAGA mob saying: 'This wasn't a group of tourists. This was an armed insurrection.' He did not mention his predecessor by name but - 16 times - referred to him as 'the former president,' accusing Trump of creating and spreading 'a web of lies about the 2020 election.'Before Biden spoke, Kamala Harris compared January 6 to 9/11 and the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, wrongly called America the 'oldest democracy in the world' and slammed the 'extremists' who stormed the Capitol.Trump called Biden's speech 'political theater' and a distraction for his failures in a statement shortly after Biden finished, and doubled down on his false claim he won the 2020 election and the result was rigged.Biden's speech was filled with descriptive phrases: Trump's 'bruised ego' and 'web of lies.' He decried the rioters for 'ransacking the capitol, destroying property, literally defecating in the hallways?'After his remarks, Biden told reporters in the Capitol that he was concerned about a new attitude in politics of it's all about it me.'That's the thing that bothers me most about the sort of attitude that seems to be emerging to some degree in American politics. It's not about you, it's about me. That's how it's viewed. But it's not about me,' he said. And he told DailyMail.com he didn't mention Trump by name because he didn't want to start a 'contemporary political battle.''I did not want to turn it into a contemporary political battle between me and the president. It's way beyond that. It's way beyond that,' he said.But Biden made his remarks at the start of 2022, the year of a midterm election where Republicans are looking to retake control of Congress and Trump is playing a kingmaker role in that party. Republicans have already attacked Biden and the Democrats for turning the one-year anniversary of the January 6th riot into a political event and accused them of trying to use the occasion to jam through legislation on voting rights.  GOP Senator Lindsey Graham accused Biden of 'brazen politicization' and called the speech an 'effort to resurrect a failed presidency.SCROLL DOWN FOR FULL SPEECH Biden mocks Trump's 'bruised ego' and the fact he 'can't accept he lost'In his remarks, Biden essentially called the former president a 'loser,' which will likely infuriate Trump. 'Because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution,' Biden stated. 'He can't accept he lost.' Vice President Kamala Harris compared the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol one year ago to the bombing of Pearl Harbor and 9/11. 'Certain dates echo throughout history, including dates that instantly remind all who have lived through them where they were and what they were doing, when our democracy came under assault,' Harris began. 'December 7, 1941, September 11, 2001 and January 6, 2021.'Harris alluded to civil rights fights of the past century. 'What the extremists who roamed these halls targeted was not only the lives of elected leaders ... what they were assaulting were the institutions, the values, the ideals that generations of Americans have marched, picketed and shed blood to establish and defend.'  'We cannot let our future be decided by those bent on silencing our voices, overturning our votes, and peddling lies and misinformation by some radical faction that may be newly resurgent, but whose roots run old and deep.' Harris then called the U.S. the 'oldest and greatest democracy in the world.' 'I wonder, how will January 6 be come to be remembered?' Harris said. 'Will it be remembered as a moment that accelerated the unraveling of the oldest and greatest democracy in the world? Or a moment when we decided to secure and strengthen our democracy for generations to come?'Democracy was coined by the Greeks in 430 B.C., means 'for the people' and many communities such as Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the UK's Isle of Man, San Marino and Switzerland have had so-called democracies dating back to the ninth and tenth centuries. He also charged that Trump continues the lie he won the election 'because he values power over principle. Because he sees his own interest as more important than his country's interest, than America's interest,' Biden said.  Trump said in his response: 'Biden is working hard to try and deflect the incompetent job he is doing, and has done, on the horrible Afghanistan withdrawal (surrender), the Borders, COVID, Inflation, loss of Energy Independence, and much more. Everything he touches turns to failure. That's what you get when you have a rigged Election.' In his speech, delivered in a nearly empty room, Biden spoke at length about the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election, offering his most detailed defense to date of his victory, which comes as Trump has continued to spout the so-called 'big lie,' that he lost out on a second term due to widespread election fraud. 'The big lie being told by the former president and many Republicans who fear his wrath is that the insurrection in this country actually took place on election day November 3, 2020,' Biden noted. The president said that Trump and his supporters are trying to 're-write history.' 'That the riot that took place on January 6 is a true expression of the will of the people. Can you think of a more twisted way to look at this country, to look at America?' Biden asked. 'I cannot.'   'Over 150 million Americans went to the polls and voted that day. In a pandemic. Some at great risk to their lives. They should be applauded not attacked,' the president added. He briefly mentioned Democrats' voting rights push, pointing out how 'new laws are being written not to protect the vote, but to deny it.' Biden will travel to Georgia on Tuesday to give a broader voting rights address. 'The former president and his supporters, the only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert our elections,' Biden said. 'It's wrong. It's undemocratic, and frankly, it is un-American.' The 'second big lie,' Biden continued, was Trump telling his supporters the results of the 2020 election can't be trusted. 'The truth is that no election, no election in American history, has been more closely scrutinized or more carefully counted,' the president pointed out.   'He was just looking for an excuse, a pretext to cover for the truth,' Biden said. 'He is not just a former president, he is a defeated former president.' 'Defeated by a margin of over 7 million of your votes. In a full and free and fair election,' Biden continued. 'There is simply zero proof the election results were inaccurate.'   A 'third big lie,' Biden said, came when Trump and his supporters called the MAGA mob who stormed the Capitol 'the nation's true patriots.' 'Is that what you thought when you looked at the mob ransacking the capitol, destroying property, literally defecating in the hallways?' the president said. 'Going through the desks of senators and representative. Hunting down members of Congress.' 'Patriots?' Biden asked. 'Not in my view.' Biden said the true patriots were the country's voters, the election workers and law enforcement who defended the Capitol on January 6. 'You can't love your country only when you win,' he said. 'You can't obey the law only when it is convenient. You can't be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies.' Biden: I didn't mention Trump because I didn't want to make it a 'contemporary political battle' Biden never used Trump's name during the Thursday morning address, instead referring to him as 'the former president.' 'I didn't want to make it a contemporary political battle,' Biden told reporters after he concluded his speech.  In a statement after Biden's speech, Trump again called the election 'rigged' and repeated 'the Big Lie was the Election itself.' 'This political theater is all just a distraction for the fact Biden has completely and totally failed,' Trump added, pointing to inflation, Afghanistan, the migrant crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border and the continued coronavirus pandemic, including school closures. The Capitol building was quiet Thursday morning as Democrats prepared to spend the day in remembrance. There was a heavy police presence and several metal interlocking barricades surrounding the building. Snow was on the ground from the storm earlier in the week. FIRST STATEMENT - 10:00AM: Biden, who is destroying our Nation with insane policies of open Borders, corrupt Elections, disastrous energy policies, unconstitutional mandates, and devastating school closures, used my name today to try to further divide America. This political theater is all just a distraction for the fact Biden has completely and totally failed. Our Country no longer has Borders, has totally and completely lost control of Covid (record numbers!), is no longer Energy Independent, Inflation is rampant, our Military is in chaos, and our exit, or surrender, from Afghanistan was perhaps the most embarrassing day in the long and distinguished history of the United States—and so much more. Why is it that the Unselect Committee of totally partisan political hacks, whose judgment has long ago been made, not discussing the rigged Presidential Election of 2020? It's because they don't have the answers or justifications for what happened. They got away with something, and it is leading to our Country's destruction. They want all conversation concerning the Election 'Canceled.' Just look at the numbers, they speak for themselves. They are not justifiable, so the complicit media just calls it the Big Lie, when in actuality the Big Lie was the Election itself.The Democrats want to own this day of January 6th so they can stoke fears and divide America. I say, let them have it because America sees through theirs lies and polarizations.SECOND STATEMENT- 10.12AM: Biden is working hard to try and deflect the incompetent job he is doing, and has done, on the horrible Afghanistan withdrawal (surrender), the Borders, COVID, Inflation, loss of Energy Independence, and much more. Everything he touches turns to failure. That's what you get when you have a rigged Election. THIRD STATEMENT -  12.39AM: To watch Biden speaking is very hurtful to many people. They're the ones who tried to stop the peaceful transfer with a rigged election. Just look at the numbers. Does anybody really think that Biden beat Obama with the Black population in select Swing State cities, but nowhere else? That he would lose 18 out of 19 bellwether counties, and 27 out of 27 'toss up' House races, but somehow miraculously receive the most votes in American history with no coattails? That he would lose Florida, Ohio, and Iowa and win, even though it has never been done before? They spread a 'web of lies' about me and Russia for 4 years to try to overturn the 2016 election, and now they lie about how they interfered in the 2020 Election, too. Big Tech was used illegally. Where did all those votes show up from in Georgia, where it was just revealed they sold ballots for $10 a piece, or in Pennsylvania, and Arizona, and Wisconsin. He acts like he's aggrieved, but we're the ones who were aggrieved and America is suffering because of it with poisonous Borders, record Inflation, a humiliating surrender in Afghanistan, $5 a gallon gas and higher, empty stock shelves, and rampant crime. America is a laughingstock stock of the world, and it's all because of the real insurrection, which took place on November 3rd, but this is an election year and MAGA Republicans should get elected and work with me to fix this horror that Joe Biden and the Democrats have brought us.Never forget the crime of the 2020 Presidential Election. Never give up!Upon arriving at the Capitol, the president told reporters, 'I'm praying that we never have another day like we had a year ago today. That's what I'm praying.' He was escorted into the building by Democratic leaders, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Mitch McConnell: Democrats are using January 6 to 'advance partisan policy Republicans have accused Democrats of playing politics with the anniversary.Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell called January 6 a 'dark day' in a statement but then pivoted to attacking Democrats for trying to change Senate rules in order to pass voting rights legislation.'It has been stunning to see some Washington Democrats try to exploit this anniversary to advance partisan policy goals that long predated this event,' McConnell said. 'It is especially jaw-dropping to hear some Senate Democrats invoke the mob's attempt to disrupt our country's norms, rules, and institutions as a justification to discard our norms, rules, and institutions themselves.' Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close friend to Trump, reacted to Biden's speech by saying, 'What brazen politicization of January 6 by President Biden.' 'I wonder if the Taliban who now rule Afghanistan with al-Qaeda elements present, contrary to President Biden's beliefs, are allowing this speech to be carried?' Graham added. Trump was supposed to address reporters Thursday from his Mar-a-Lago resort, but called off the press conference Tuesday night. The Biden administration has been reluctant to directly discuss Trump particularly given that the former president continues the false claim that he won the 2020 presidential election.But White House press secretary  Psaki did not mince words in her press briefing Wednesday about the administration's view of Trump. The former president addressed his supporters outside the White House on January 6, 2021 before they marched on the Capitol and tried to stop the certification of Biden's victory. House Democrats impeached Trump for his role but he was acquitted by the Senate. Biden has been 'clear eyed about the threat the former president represents to our democracy and how the former president constantly works to constantly undermine basic American values and rule of law,' Psaki said. She noted that Biden sees January 6th as a 'tragic culmination of what those four years under President Trump did to our country.'    In a bid capitalize on the anniversary, Democrats on committee are looking to crank up the pace of their probe and draw a massive audience with prime-time hearings. 'I have favored this strategy from the beginning,' Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, a member of the panel, told MSNBC's Morning Joe on Wednesday. He said he wanted a Watergate-style approach, when the 1973 hearings into Richard Nixon's presidency captivated America. At one point an estimated 85% of the country was tuned in to them.'I remember as a kid getting to watch a bit of the Watergate hearings, which were a daily spectacle that the whole country tuned into,' Raskin said. 'If we can do that for, you know, a break-in in a couple of offices in the Watergate hotel, certainly, we can do it for a massive break-in into the Capitol of the United States, a storming, and a seizure essentially of our government offices, an interruption of the peaceful transfer of power.'Those prime-time hearings could occur in late March or early April, Rep. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, told Bloomberg News.But no date has been set yet. 'We're working toward that,' Thompson said. Those hearings would also feature high-profile witnesses, which would help them gain maximum exposure. Among those names being considered are former Vice President Mike Pence.Pence was under heavy pressure from Trump to declare the 2020 election results invalid, wipe out Joe Biden's victory and secure him a second term. The vice president has the symbolic role of presiding over the Electoral College certification of results. Pence was a target of the January 6th rioters, some of who threatened to hang him, and was evacuated from the Senate floor as the MAGA supporters stormed the Capitol.Thompson told CNN that he and the panel would like to hear from Pence.'I would hope that he would do the right thing and come forward and voluntarily talk to the committee,' he said.'We have not formally asked. But if he offered, we'd gladly accept. Everything is under consideration,' he added. So far, in its investigation, the committee has interviewed more than 300 witnesses, announced more than 50 subpoenas, obtained more than 35,000 pages of records and received hundreds of telephone tips through their Jan. 6 tipline, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Names are starting to be lined up for hearings.  Madam Vice President, my fellow Americans: To state the obvious, one year ago today, in this sacred place, democracy was attacked -- simply attacked. The will of the people was under assault. The Constitution -- our Constitution -- faced the gravest of threats.Outnumbered and in the face of a brutal attack, the Capitol Police, the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, the National Guard, and other brave law enforcement officials saved the rule of law.Our democracy held. We the people endured. And we the people prevailed.For the first time in our history, a president had not just lost an election, he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob breached the Capitol.But they failed. They failed.And on this day of remembrance, we must make sure that such an attack never, never happens again.I'm speaking to you today from Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol. This is where the House of Representativesmet for 50 years in the decades leading up to the Civil War. This is -- on this floor is where a young congressman of Illinois, Abraham Lincoln, sat at desk 191.Above him -- above us, over that door leading into the Rotunda -- is a sculpture depicting Clio, the muse of history. In her hands, an open book in which she records the events taking place in this chamber below.Clio stood watch over this hall one year ago today, as she has for more than 200 years. She recorded what took place. The real history. The real facts. The real truth. The factsand the truth that Vice President Harris just shared and that you and I and the whole world saw with our own eyes.The Bible tells us that we shall know the truth, and the truth shall make us free. We shall know the truth.Well, here is the God's truth about January 6th, 2021:Close your eyes. Go back to that day. What do you see? Rioters rampaging, waving for the first time inside this Capitol a Confederate flag that symbolized the cause to destroy America, to rip us apart.Even during the Civil War, that never, ever happened. But it happened here in 2021.What else do you see? A mob breaking windows, kicking in doors, breaching the Capitol. American flags on poles being used as weapons, as spears. Fire extinguishers being thrown at the heads of police officers.A crowd that professes their love for law enforcement assaulted those police officers, dragged them, sprayed them, stomped on them.Over 140 police officers were injured.We've all heard the police officers who were there that day testify to what happened. One officer called it, quote, a med- -- 'medieval' battle, and that he was more afraid that day than he was fighting the war in Iraq.They've repeatedly asked since that day: How dare anyone -- anyone -- diminish, belittle, or deny the hell they were put through?We saw it with our own eyes. Rioters menaced these halls, threatening the life of the Speaker of the House, literally erecting gallows to hang the Vice President of the United States of America.But what did we not see?We didn't see a former president, who had just rallied the mob to attack -- sitting in the private dining room off the Oval Office in the White House, watching it all on television and doing nothing for hours as police were assaulted, lives at risk, and the nation's capital under siege.This wasn't a group of tourists. This was an armed insurrection.They weren't looking to uphold the will of the people. They were looking to deny the will of the people.They were looking to uphold -- they weren't looking to uphold a free and fair election. They were looking to overturn one.They weren't looking to save the cause of America. They were looking to subvert the Constitution.This isn't about being bogged down in the past. This is about making sure the past isn't buried.That's the only way forward. That's what great nations do. They don't bury the truth, they face up to it. Sounds like hyperbole, but that's the truth: They face up to it.We are a great nation.My fellow Americans, in life, there's truth and,tragically, there are lies -- lies conceived and spread for profit and power.We must be absolutely clear about what is true and what is a lie.And here is the truth: The former president of theUnited States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election. He's done so because he values power over principle, because he sees his own interests as more important than his country's interests and America's interests, and because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution.He can't accept he lost, even though that's what 93 United States senators, his own Attorney General, his own Vice President, governors and state officials in every battleground state have all said: He lost.That's what 81 million of you did as you voted for a new way forward.He has done what no president in American history -- the history of this country -- has ever, ever done: He refused to accept the results of an election and the will of the American people.While some courageous men and women in the Republican Party are standing against it, trying to uphold the principles of that party, too many others are transforming that party into something else. They seem no longer to want to be the party -- the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Reagan, the Bushes.But whatever my other disagreements are with Republicans who support the rule of law and not the rule of a single man, I will always seek to work together with them to find shared solutions where possible. Because if we have a shared belief in democracy, then anything is possible -- anything.And so, at this moment, we must decide: What kind of nation are we going to be?Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm?Are we going to be a nation where we allow partisan election officials to overturn the legally expressed will of the people?Are we going to be a nation that lives not by the light of the truth but in the shadow of lies?We cannot allow ourselves to be that kind of nation. The way forward is to recognize the truth and to live by it.The Big Lie being told by the former president and many Republicans who fear his wrath is that the insurrection in this country actually took place on Election Day -- November 3rd, 2020.Think about that. Is that what you thought? Is that what you thought when you voted that day? Taking part in an insurrection? Is that what you thought you were doing? Or did you think you were carrying out your highest duty as a citizen and voting?The former president and his supporters are trying to rewrite history. They want you to see Election Day as the day of insurrection and the riot that took place here on January 6th as the true expression of the will of the people.Can you think of a more twisted way to look at this country -- to look at America? I cannot.Here's the truth: The election of 2020 was the greatest demonstration of democracy in the history of this country.More of you voted in that election than have ever voted in all of American history. Over 150 million Americans went to the polls and voted that day in a pandemic -- some at grea- -- great risk to their lives. They should be applauded, not attacked.Right now, in state after state, new laws are being written -- not to protect the vote, but to deny it; not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert it; not to strengthen or protect our democracy, but because the former president lost.Instead of looking at the election results from 2020 and saying they need new ideas or better ideas to win more votes, the former president and his supporters have decided the only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert our elections.It's wrong. It's undemocratic. And frankly, it's un-American.The second Big Lie being told by the former President and his supporters is that the results of the election of 2020 can't be trusted.The truth is that no election -- no election in American history has been more closely scrutinized or more carefully counted.Every legal challenge questioning the results in every court in this country that could have been made was made and was rejected -- often rejected by Republican-appointed judges, including judges appointed by the former president himself, from state courts to the United States Supreme Court.Recounts were undertaken in state after state. Georgia -- Georgia counted its results three times, with one recount by hand.Phony partisan audits were undertaken long after the election in several states. None changed the results. And in some of them, the irony is the margin of victory actually grew slightly.So, let's speak plainly about what happened in 2020. Even before the first ballot was cast, the former presidentwas preemptively sowing doubt about the election results. He built his lie over months. It wasn't based on any facts. He was just looking for an excuse -- a pretext -- to cover for the truth.He's not just a former president. He's a defeated former president -- defeated by a margin of over 7 million of your votes in a full and free and fair election.There is simply zero proof the election results were inaccurate. In fact, in every venue where evidence had to be produced and an oath to tell the truth had to be taken, the former president failed to make his case.Just think about this: The former president and his supporters have never been able to explain how they accept as accurate the other election results that took place on November 3rd -- the elections for governor, United States Senate, the House of Representatives -- elections in which they closed the gap in the House.They challenge none of that. The President's name was first, then we went down the line -- governors, senators, House of Representatives. Somehow, those results were accurate on the same ballot, but the presidential race was flawed?And on the same ballot, the same day, cast by the same voters.The only difference: The former President didn't lose those races; he just lost the one that was his own.Finally, the third Big Lie being told by a former President and his supporters is that the mob who sought to impose their will through violence are the nation's true patriots.Is that what you thought when you looked at the mob ransacking the Capitol, destroying property, literally defecating in the hallways, rifling through desks of senators and representatives, hunting down members of congress? Patriots? Not in my view.To me, the true patriots were the more than 150 [million] Americans who peacefully expressed their vote at the ballot box, the election workers who protected the integrity of the vote, and the heroes who defended this Capitol.You can't love your country only when you win.You can't obey the law only when it's convenient.You can't be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies.Those who stormed this Capitol and those who instigated and incited and those who called on them to do so held a dagger at the throat of America -- at American democracy.They didn't come here out of patriotism or principle. They came here in rage -- not in service of America, but rather in service of one man.Those who incited the mob -- the real plotters -- who were desperate to deny the certification of the election and defy the will of the voters.But their plot was foiled. Congressmen -- Democrats and Republicans -- stayed. Senators, representatives, staff -- they finished their work the Constitution demanded. They honored their oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.Look, folks, now it's up to all of us -- to 'We the People' -- to stand for the rule of law, to preserve the flame of democracy, to keep the promise of America alive.That promise is at risk, targeted by the forces that value brute strength over the sanctity of democracy, fear over hope, personal gain over public good.Make no mistake about it: We're living at an inflection point in history.Both at home and abroad, we're engaged anew in a struggle between democracy and autocracy, between the aspirations of the many and the greed of the few, between the people's right of self-determination and self- -- the self-seeking autocrat.From China to Russia and beyond, they're betting that democracy's days are numbered. They've actually told me democracy is too slow, too bogged down by division to succeed in today's rapidly changing, complicated world.And they're betting -- they're betting America will become more like them and less like us. They're betting that America is a place for the autocrat, the dictator, the strongman.I do not believe that. That is not who we are. That is not who we have ever been. And that is not who we should ever, ever be.Our Founding Fathers, as imperfect as they were, set in motion an experiment that changed the world -- literally changed the world.Here in America, the people would rule, power would be transferred peacefully -- never at the tip of a spear or the barrel of a gun.And they committed to paper an idea that couldn't live up to -- they couldn't live up to but an idea that couldn't be constrained: Yes, in America all people are created equal.We reject the view that if you succeed, I fail; if you get ahead, I fall behind; if I hold you down, I somehow lift myself up.The former President, who lies about this election, and the mob that attacked this Capitol could not be further away from the core American values.They want to rule or they will ruin -- ruin what our country fought for at Lexington and Concord; at Gettysburg; at Omaha Beach; Seneca Falls; Selma, Alabama. What -- and what we were fighting for: the right to vote, the right to govern ourselves, the right to determine our own destiny.And with rights come responsibilities: the responsibility to see each other as neighbors -- maybe we disagree with that neighbor, but they're not an adversary; the responsibility to accept defeat then get back in the arena and try again the next time to make your case; the responsibility to see that America is an idea -- an idea that requires vigilant stewardship.As we stand here today -- one year since January 6th, 2021 -- the lies that drove the anger and madness we saw in this place, they have not abated.So, we have to be firm, resolute, and unyielding in our defense of the right to vote and to have that vote counted.Some have already made the ultimate sacrifice in this sacred effort.Jill and I have mourned police officers in this Capitol Rotunda not once but twice in the wake of January 6th: once to honor Officer Brian Sicknick, who lost his life the day after the attack, and a second time to honor Officer Billy Evans, who lost his life defending this Capitol as well.We think about the others who lost their lives and were injured and everyone living with the trauma of that day -- from those defending this Capitol to members of Congress in both parties and their staffs, to reporters, cafeteria workers, custodial workers, and their families.Don't kid yourself: The pain and scars from that day run deep.I said it many times and it's no more true or real than when we think about the events of January 6th: We are in a battle for the soul of America. A battle that, by the grace of God and the goodness and gracious -- and greatness of this nation, we will win.Believe me, I know how difficult democracy is. And I'm crystal clear about the threats America faces. But I also know that our darkest days can lead to light and hope.From the death and destruction, as the Vice President referenced, in Pearl Harbor came the triumph over the forces of fascism.From the brutality of Bloody Sunday on the Edmund Pettus Bridge came historic voting rights legislation.So, now let us step up, write the next chapter in American history where January 6th marks not the end of democracy, but the beginning of a renaissance of liberty and fair play.I did not seek this fight brought to this Capitol one year ago today, but I will not shrink from it either.I will stand in this breach. I will defend this nation. And I will allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy.We will make sure the will of the people is heard; that the ballot prevails, not violence; that authority in this nation will always be peacefully transferred.I believe the power of the presidency and the purpose is to unite this nation, not divide it; to lift us up, not tear us apart; to be about us -- about us, not about 'me.'Deep in the heart of America burns a flame lit almost 250 years ago -- of liberty, freedom, and equality.This is not a land of kings or dictators or autocrats. We're a nation of laws; of order, not chaos; of peace, not violence.Here in America, the people rule through the ballot, and their will prevails.So, let us remember: Together, we're one nation, under God, indivisible; that today, tomorrow, and forever, at our best, we are the United States of America.God bless you all. May God protect our troops. And may God bless those who stand watch over our democracy.  ",0.105
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10376903/Kamala-Harris-INSIDE-DNC-headquarters-pipe-bomb-outside-January-6-Report.html,"Vice President Kamala Harris was inside the Democratic Party's National Headquarters on January 6 last year when a pipe bomb was discovered outside the building, a new report claimed on Thursday.She was evacuated just minutes after the Capitol Police began investigating it, according to documents obtained by Politico. The explosives were reportedly placed there the night before, meaning Harris would have entered the building while a bomb was nearby.The newly-revealed account of the United States Capitol Police's timeline of events when Donald Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol building raises fresh questions about the extent of security failings that day.Exactly one year to the day of the insurrection, the FBI is still looking for the suspect who placed two of the explosive devices outside of both the Republican and Democrat headquarters.At 1:07 p.m. on January 6, law enforcement reportedly began probing the pipe bomb placed outside Democrats' building.Just seven minutes later at 1:14 p.m. an unnamed 'protectee' was escorted out by Capitol Police and the Secret Service.Four sources including a White House official and a former law enforcement official told Politico that 'protectee' was Harris. Previously revealed timelines show protesters had broken into the Capitol and shattered the glass windows less than an hour later.According to the timeline viewed by the outlet, the DNC bomb threat was neutralized at 4:36 p.m. The bomb found outside of the RNC was neutralized about an hour earlier.Harris, who was a sitting senator at the time, remarked on her absence from the Capitol but did not elaborate further in her speech marking one year since the riot on Thursday morning. She and her colleagues were meant to be attending a Joint Session of Congress to certify her and Joe Biden's electoral victory when Trump's supporters broke into the building in a bid to stop the process.'I had left, but my thoughts immediately turned not only to my colleagues, but to my staff who had been forced to seek refuge in our office, converting filing cabinets into barricades,' the vice president said this morning. Law enforcement and intelligence officials have been criticized for not being better prepared for the mob that overwhelmed officers and shattered glass to get into the Capitol complex.Forces that had to be diverted to the bomb threats further added to the strain on law enforcement trying to keep Trump's supporters out.The FBI has since said the explosives were 'viable' and 'could have been detonated, resulting in serious injury or death.'Early accounts of Harris' timeline during riot were also highlighted in Thursday's report. Although little has been reported about her specific movements before now, she had been scheduled to attend an intelligence briefing at the Capitol that morning before departing for a previously-planned engagement. She later returned after the riot when lawmakers resumed the election certification process.The FBI put out its latest call for help in identifying the pipe bomb suspect in September.A person wearing a light hooded sweatshirt and dark pants carrying a backpack was identified as having placed the explosives at the DNC and RNC on the evening of January 5. National Republican figures have been criticizing federal investigators in recent days for not yet having found the suspect. 'A year later, congressional Democrats have focused on political theater, have not explained why they left the Capitol vulnerable, and have never mentioned the pipe bombs placed at RNC and DNC headquarters,' RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told DailyMail.com for a separate story on Wednesday.'To date, the terrorist who placed the bombs has still not been found. As we have said repeatedly, violence cannot be tolerated, but for Democrats, this is all about politics and primetime headlines, and has nothing to do with justice or democracy.'South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham echoed a similar call on Twitter Thursday.'Those responsible for Capitol security including our political leaders must also be held accountable' for the riot,' the GOP senator wrote.'We still do not know who planted pipe bombs on Capitol Hill the night of Jan 5. We still do not know why our Capitol was not adequately defended before President Trump spoke.'",0.076
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10376391/House-Democrats-recount-January-6-experieces.html,"House Democrats gathered Thursday afternoon to share their 'testimonials' about what they experienced one year ago during the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6.  Rep. Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chair who became a punching bag for former President Donald Trump during his first impeachment, recalled how that prominence colored his experience. 'I stayed behind for awhile until two Republicans came up to me,' Schiff said, recounting how lawmakers were vacating the House chamber. 'One of them said, ""You can't let them see you. I know these people. I can talk to these people. I can talk my way through these people. You're in a whole different category.""' Rep. Colin Allred, a Texas Democrat and former NFL player, told his fellow Democrats: 'I thought when I left the NFL as a linebacker, where my job was to put people on the ground, that those abilities and the need to do that were over.'  Allred then thanked those law enforcement officers who engaged in true hand-to-hand combat that day. Gladys and Charles Sicknick, the parents of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died a day after engaging with protesters at the riot, were in the audience for the House Democrats' event held on campus on Capitol Hill.   'I'll say to the Sicknick family, I'll say to you, your son's sacrifice allowed me to meet mine,' Allred said. The event was hosted by Rep. Jason Crow, a Democrat from Colorado and military veteran, credited with having Capitol Police lock the last House gallery entrance preventing the MAGA mob from swarming into the House chamber.He received accolades for other reasons too.  Rep. Sara Jacobs, a California Democrat who had been sworn-in three days prior, thanked Crow 'for the glass of whiskey you poured me after we finally got back to our offices on January 6.A number of lawmakers recounted being trapped in the House gallery and noted how they had no idea there were gas masks tucked under the seats.  'Like many of you trapped in the House gallery, I remember every moment vividly. I viscerally feel the pounding on the gallery doors. I hear the shot ringing out. replay how I made plans to use my gas mask and my cane – newly at my side five week old knee replacement surgery – to fight back if attacked,' said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.  'And I remember not knowing if we would make it out of our seat of democracy alive or if our democracy itself would survive,' she added. She said that on January 6 'we saved our democracy,' crediting 'all the voters that came out in the most important election in our lifetimes that delivered us a new president who is not corrupted by his love of power and lack of regard for our Constitution.' Rep. Mike Quigley also remembered Jayapal's cane. 'She was upset she was walking so slowly with her cane that she was afraid that that would allow the insurrectionists to catch up to us,' Quigley said. 'And [Rep.] Brad Schneider was just ahead of us, and you heard her say this. And he came back and walked on her left side, and he said, ""Well then we'll all just walk togeher.' 'I was never more proud at that moment to walk alongside all of you,' the Illinois Democrat said. 'It reminds me that we have to walk alongside and help guide our country away from darkness as we walk together into that bright light of our democracy.' Quigley also paid homage to journalists who worked through the attack.  'There's a photo I saw the other day I'd completely forgot about,' he said. 'We've seen the images and we know what to expect - the broken glass, the guns drawn, the makeshift barricades. I remember sheltering in place.' 'But I saw something I'd forgotten. It was a reporter in the midst of all this,' he continued. 'It was a reporter in the midst of all this. Bent over her keyboard still working.'      Other lawmakers recalled being stuck in their Congressional offices for hours. Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, a Pennsylvania Democrat who was the recent victim of a carjacking, said she was in her office on the phone 'getting tips from a friend who's a high school teacher on how to barricade my office door.' 'She had done that before, I hadn't,' Scanlon noted, alluding to the trend of schools having to go through active shooter trainer. 'I was most concerned, as others have said, that my children not be worried - so I sent them a picture of me with a bottle of Jameson's I had found in one of my staffer's cupboards,' Scanlon recounted. She added, 'America survived a coup last year, but only just barely.' Rep. Susan Wild, also a Pennsylvania Democrat, talked about the scene in one of the rooms lawmakers were kept hidden by law enforcement. She noted how many of the lawmakers had taken their Congressional lapel pins off, so to not be identified as members of Congress by the MAGA mob. 'And I ran into one of my new freshman colleagues, a black man, and he still had his pin on and I said ... ""We should take our pins off. You need to take your pin off."" And he looked right at me and he said, ""I want them to know I'm a member of Congress,' Wild recalled. She implored Americans to start talking to those across the aisle, so that January 6 never happens again.'Talk to them. That neighbor who flies a political flag you don't agree with,' Wild encouraged. 'Find something to talk to that neighbor about that you can agree on - the flowers and their beauty, the dog, the frolicking children in the neighborhood, the weather, find something you can share with that person with whom you disagree on political matters.'    Rep. Mikie Sherrill gave one Republican a hat-tip too - Rep. Liz Cheney, the only Republican House member - who brought along her dad, former Vice President Dick Cheney - to be in the House chamber for the noon moment of silence. 'And so I think it's appropriate to point out one person who I think has shown a great deal of moral courage,' Sherrill said. 'Someone who has stood up for her country, at great personal cost, and that's Liz Cheney.'  ",0.072
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10376627/Ashli-Babbitts-mother-stands-alongside-Marjorie-Taylor-Green-outside-Capitol.html,"The mother of slain Capitol rioter Ashli Babbitt has called for the release of surveillance footage of her police shooting death on the one year anniversary of the killing. Babbitt, 36, was fatally shot by Capitol police officer Michael Byrd during the Capitol riot as she tried to climb through a broken window into the Speaker's Lobby outside the House chamber.  On Thursday her mother Micki Witthoeft appeared outside the Capitol with controversial Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, demanding Speaker Nancy Pelosi release surveillance footage from the shooting and calling for 'justice' for those arrested in the riot, whom she called political prisoners. 'She served this country her whole adult life,' Witthoeft said of Babbitt, an Air Force veteran. 'She loved God, loved America, loved her family, and came to DC to hear Donald Trump speak about a stolen election.'Witthoeft said that her daughter was 'murdered' by Byrd, whom she called 'careless and reckless.'An investigation into Babbitt's death by the US Capitol Police and the United States Department of Justice determined that the shooting was 'lawful and within Department policy''I feel like the Capitol police need to change the way they do things, they operate with impunity, which I did not know until my daughter was publicly executed,' Witthoeft told reporters.Witthoeft addressed Pelosi, telling the House speaker: 'This is not your playhouse or your private domain.' 'These surveillance cameras were put up to capture what happened that day, the American people have a right to see the 14,000 hours of footage,' she said.She appeared to be referring to footage provided by Capitol police to two key committees investigating the Capitol assault, The House Administration Committee and the Senate Rules Committee, which has not been made public. 'You're not the queen, Nancy Pelosi. This is America's 14,000 hours of missing footage. We have a right to see it,' said Witthoeft. Babbitt's death has been a lightning rod in the debate over the Capitol riot, with Trump's loyalists painting her as a patriotic martyr, and his detractors dismissing her as a conspiracy-spouting extremist. An Air Force veteran who served in Iraq and previously voted for Barack Obama, Babbitt died wrapped in a flag bearing Trump's name, convinced of his claims that the 2020 election was stolen. Babbitt was among the first of hundreds of people to breach the Capitol building's security, as elected officials barricaded themselves in rooms, cowering from an angry mob.In footage filmed by one of the intruders, she could be seen trying to get through a broken window into the Speaker's Lobby.'Go! Come on!' she shouts, encouraging those behind her to hoist her in.As her head appears through the window, a Capitol police officer fires his weapon, striking Babbitt in the shoulder. She would die from her injuries.Babbitt was born in 1985 to a modest Southern California family in the San Diego suburbs, where politics was not particularly important, said Roger Witthoeft, one of her four younger brothers in an interview with AFP. She enlisted in the Air Force at age 17, straight from school, and did tours of Afghanistan and Iraq.Subsequent spells in the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard led to a posting near Washington, as well as two more deployments to the Middle East.Babbitt left the military as a relatively low-ranking senior airman in 2016, several years before she would have become eligible for a pension or other benefits, and she returned to her hometown, not far from the Mexican border.There, she and her second husband took over a struggling pool maintenance company.In videos posted to social media, Babbitt raged against both the homeless and undocumented migrants, castigating Democratic elected officials for 'refusing to acknowledge or even admit that we do need' a wall on the Mexican border -- Trump's signature campaign pledge.'The border is an absolute s**t show,' she said. 'There's riots, there's arrests, there's rapes, there's drugs... there are tons of issues.'I want my politicians to start coming down here and telling me that my reality is a lie.'You guys refuse to choose America over your stupid political party.'She attended Trump rallies wearing the red 'Make America Great Again' hat that symbolized the movement, and presented herself on Twitter as a 'libertarian.'It was here that she railed against the 'pedophiles' and 'satanists' she believed controlled the Democratic Party.To her brother, Babbitt was just 'a normal Californian.''The issues she was mad about were the things all of us are mad about,' he said.'That was one of her things -- for the first time in her life, she could actually say what she wanted to say, and didn't have to bottle it up' as she had had to do in the military.When the Covid-19 pandemic took hold of the United States, Babbitt embraced the anti-science rhetoric of the hard right.A sign posted on the door of her company read: 'Mask free autonomous zone, better known as America,' where 'we shake hands like men.'On January 5, she took to social media again, writing: 'Nothing will stop us...they can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon (Washington) DC in less than 24 hours...dark to light!'The phraseology is common among followers of QAnon, the loose amalgam of conspiracy theories that sees present-day politics as an existential fight between good and evil.For some fellow travelers, this invocation was enough to earn Babbitt immortality as a woman fighting for the soul of America, a tragic heroine who fell in battle.Babbitt's mother told The Washington Post her daughter 'made the ultimate sacrifice' to bring attention to what she said was 'a stolen election.'But she acknowledged that not everyone agrees.'Half the country loves her and half the country hates her,' she told the paper. 'It's weird to have your child belong to the world.' DailyMail.com first revealed last year how Babbitt, a Trump supporter who was fatally shot by police while attempting to enter the Capitol building during the ill-fated insurrection early last year, had harassed, chased and rammed Celeste Norris with her SUV in July of 2016. At the time, Babbit, then 30, was engaged in an extramarital affair with Norris' then boyfriend of six years, Aaron Babbit - the man Babbit would eventually wed. Now, however, speaking publicly for the first time since the incident with the Associated Press, jilted lover Norris decided to detail the horrors she faced at the hands of the late Air Force veteran, who has been hailed as a hero by right-wingers for her part in the 2020 attacks.   Norris, 40, told the Press exclusively Monday that her first encounter with Babbitt in 2015 was a rude one, when the future insurrectionist rammed her vehicle three times with an SUV, and proceeded to exit the car and pound on the window of Norris' Ford Explorer, challenging her to a fight.'She pulls up yelling and screaming,' Norris said in an exclusive interview with The Press, recounting the July 29, 2016, incident, which occurred in Prince Frederick, Maryland. 'It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out who she was.' Norris added that Babbitt - who was married to another man during the affair - also hit her with a barrage of 'all sorts of expletives, telling me to get out of the car, that she was going to beat my ass.'",0.063
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10376473/Matt-Gaetz-Marjorie-Taylor-Greene-claim-government-staged-fed-surrection-January-6.html,"GOP Reps. Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene held a press conference marking one year since the Capitol riot Thursday where they promoted a fringe conspiracy theory that the federal government was behind the deadly events that day.They claimed that people added to the FBI's Most Wanted list for breaking into the United States Capitol last year simply 'fall off' like Ray Epps, a military veteran who members of the far-right have claimed to be an 'FBI plant' goading Donald Trump's supporters into violence that day. 'Congresswoman Greene and I are not here to celebrate January 6. We're not here to obsess about it, but we're here to expose the truth, to ask key questions about what happened on January 6, what animated the violence, the extent to which the federal government had been involved,' Gaetz said at the outset of their media event.'We know this -- January 6 last year wasn't an insurrection. No one has been charged with insurrection. No one has been charged with treason. But it may very well may have been a fed-surrection.' The two firebrand Republicans countered Democrats' solemn day of retrospection to with their own alternative slate of programming focused on questioning the security failures that occurred that day and undermining House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's January 6 committee. That included Greene appearing outside of the Capitol with the mother of Ashi Babbitt, the Air Force veteran who was shot and killed by a Capitol police officer when she was at the head of a mob breaking through a window near the Speaker's Lobby. Greene and Gaetz sought to frame the Trump supporters who entered the Capitol as having been manipulated by undercover federal agents and those who were subsequently arrested over it as political prisoners.'We are very concerned that we have sent letter after letter to Attorney General Garland and FBI Director Wray to simply get to the bottom of unexplained circumstances where people are on the FBI Most Wanted List from January 6, and then they fall off of that list,' Gaetz said during the press conference. They played a series of videos that showed Epps, a Marine veteran who once ran a chapter of the far-right Oath Keepers group, directing people toward the Capitol on January 6.There is no evidence that Epps ever entered the building himself that day and he was never arrested in connection with the storming. In one video he's seen in the street on January 5 saying: 'I'm going to put it out there. I'm probably going to go to jail for it, OK? Tomorrow, we need to go into the Capitol. Into the Capitol…peacefully.'At that point some in the crowd clearly believe he is a plant and begin to chant: 'Fed! Fed! Fed!'The following day, Epps can be seen in another clip dressed in military-style clothing and yelling to a crowd: 'OK folks, spread the word. As soon as the president is done speaking, we go to the Capitol, where our problems are.'Pointing behind him, he adds: 'It's that direction. Please spread the word.''Imagine if we actually had the powers of the January 6 committee, the powers of the federal government to understand why Ray Epps, the evening of the 5th is out telling people dispassionately, professionally, with laser focus that the objective is to enter the United States Capitol building?' Gaetz said on Thursday.He claimed Epps was on the FBI's Most Wanted List but was mysteriously removed after right-wing blog Revolver labeled him a 'Fed-protected provocateur.' But rather than disband the committee, Gaetz said he would want to reshape it if Republicans took back the majority in 2022.'I would throw off the tyrants that are on that committee now. I would make Marjorie Taylor Greene the chair. I would make Darren Beattie the staff director, and then we would get the truth in front of the American people,' he said. Gaetz also lashed out at GOP Senator Ted Cruz, who yesterday branded the riot a 'violent terrorist attack.''The establishment will never love you, Ted,' Gaetz quipped.'You can bend over -- bend the knee for them, but they're just not gonna love you.' Cruz's comments at a Wednesday Senate Rules Committee hearing are more in line with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's reflections a year after the insurrection than with Trump's, though like most allies of the former president he didn't ascribe him any blame. 'I think that's maybe an effort by the good senator -- who we agree with on many, many things -- to recast himself  in the eyes of some of the folks in your profession,' Gaetz told the journalists, adding: 'But we didn't find it particularly factual or sincere.' Greene said she 'completely disagrees' with Cruz and criticized his comments as 'irresponsible.'Earlier in the day she appeared alongside Micki Witthoeft, who stood outside the Capitol and declared the riot where her daughter Ashli Babbitt was killed was a 'protest' and not an 'insurrection.''The mainstream media needs to stop pushing that narrative forward and at this point, that should be a libelous comment,' Witthoeft said standing next to Greene.'My daughter was a proud American patriot, she served this country her whole adult life, she loved God, loved America, loved her family, and came to DC to hear Donald Trump speak about a stolen election.'Babbitt's mother said 'she was murdered by a careless, reckless Capitol police officer, Michael Byrd, who should've been fired two years ago.'Last year two separate investigations, one by the Justice Department and an internal Capitol Police probe, cleared Byrd of any wrongdoing. ",0.086
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10376373/Jen-Psaki-said-maybe-Trump-learned-watching-Biden-speech.html,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki took a swipe at Donald Trump on Thursday, saying maybe 'he learned something' when he watched President Joe Biden's remarks on the one-year anniversary of January 6th.The former president blasted Biden's speech, calling it 'political theater.'Psaki shrugged off the attack when asked about it in her daily press briefing, saying she was glad Trump watched the speech. 'Maybe he learned something,' she said. 'It looks like he saw the speech, I guess that's good news. Maybe he learned something about what it looks like to meet the moment in the country,' she noted. Psaki also went after Republican lawmakers, saying they 'need to take a look at themselves and think about what role they want to play in the history books. When their children and grandchildren look at the history books. Do they want to be perpetuating the big lie? Do they want to be walking like the silent lemmings behind the former president?President Biden said he didn't mention Trump by name in his speech because he didn't want to start a 'contemporary political battle.''I did not want to turn it into a contemporary political battle between me and the president. It's way beyond that. It's way beyond that,' he said in response to a question from DailyMail.com in the halls of the Capitol after his remarks.He also said he was concerned about a new attitude in politics of it's all about me.'That's the thing that bothers me most about the sort of attitude that seems to be emerging to some degree in American politics. It's not about you, it's about me. That's how it's viewed. But it's not about me,' he said. During his speech, Biden tore into Trump for watching TV while a mob stormed the Capitol on January 6, mocked his 'bruised ego' and accused him and his supporters of holding a 'dagger in the throat of democracy.'In his most searing attack on his predecessor to date, Biden called Trump a 'defeated former president' and criticized him for 'refusing to accept he lost' the November 2020 in remarks on the one-year anniversary of the attack alongside Kamala Harris.'We saw with our own eyes rioters menace these halls, threatening the life of the Speaker of the House. Literally erecting gallows to hang the vice president of the United States of America,' Biden recalled. 'What did we not see? We didn't see a former president, who just rallied the mob to attack, sitting in a private dining room off the Oval Office in the White House watching it all on television and doing nothing for hours.'    In his speech Biden mentioned his predecessor or former president 16 times - but he never said Trump's name. But Biden made his remarks at the start of 2022, the year of a midterm election where Republicans are looking to retake control of Congress and Trump is playing a kingmaker role in that party.In his response, Trump called Biden's speech 'political theater' and a distraction for his failures and doubled down on his false claim he won the 2020 election and the result was rigged.'This political theater is all just a distraction for the fact Biden has completely and totally failed,' Trump wrote in a statement. 'The Democrats want to own this day of January 6th so they can stoke fears and divide America,' he added. 'I say, let them have it because America sees through theirs [sic] lies and polarizations.' 'They spread a 'web of lies' about me and Russia for 4 years to try to overturn the 2016 election, and now they lie about how they interfered in the 2020 Election, too,' he said noted in one of his three statements released Thursday. In his 25-minute speech, delivered in a nearly empty room, Biden spoke at length about the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election, offering his most detailed defense to date of his victory, which comes as Trump has continued to spout the so-called 'big lie,' that he lost out on a second term due to widespread election fraud. 'The big lie being told by the former president and many Republicans who fear his wrath is that the insurrection in this country actually took place on election day November 3, 2020,' Biden noted. The president said that Trump and his supporters are trying to 're-write history.' 'That the riot that took place on January 6 is a true expression of the will of the people. Can you think of a more twisted way to look at this country, to look at America?' Biden asked. 'I cannot.'   'Over 150 million Americans went to the polls and voted that day. In a pandemic. Some at great risk to their lives. They should be applauded not attacked,' the president added. GOP Rep. Liz Cheney and her father, former vice president Dick, were the only two Republicans standing in the House chamber when Speaker Nancy Pelosi held a moment of silence on the first anniversary of January 6.   Pelosi announced the moment of silence as one of a series of events to mark the anniversary days in advance, and had asked lawmakers to tell her office if they planned to attend.But when it came time for the moment at noon Thursday, Cheney, a member of the select House committee probing January 6, didn't have much company on her side of the aisle.The 80-year-old Cheney served as a member of the House leadership before serving at vice president to George W. Bush. He stood next to his daughter on the otherwise abandoned right side of the aisle during the moment of silence. Dick Cheney, who served as chair of the GOP conference and as party whip when he was in the House, took a shot at party leaders who have sidelined his daughter and said he doesn't recognize today's Republican party. He was forced to give up her own leadership post after she voted to impeach Donald Trump after January 6. 'It's not leadership that resembles any of the folks I knew when I was here for ten years,' he told reporters in the Capitol. He also criticized the party for their handling of the events after the Capitol riot and their 'failure to defend the constitution'.Asked if he was disappointed with how leaders treated his daughter, Cheney said: 'My daughter can take care of herself.'   Asked about the low GOP turnout at the moment of silence, he responded, Liz Cheney responded: 'I think it’s a reflection of where our party is. … very concerning.'She added: 'I think the future of our country is at stake. And there are moments when we all have to come together in order to defend the Constitution.' Asked about Trump's influence – he has been weighing in in primaries and runs far ahead of other in early 2024 polls, she said: 'Look, I think that a party who is enthralled to a cult of personality is a party that is dangerous for the country. And I think that we've really got to get to a place where we're focused on substance and on issues of policy.'During an opening prayer, House chaplain Margaret Kibben said: 'As compatriots, we are too often separated by politics and perspectives, individual certainties and intractable opinions' and prayed for unity. 'Today one year ago the Capitol and those who work with it were targeted in a violent insurrection,' Pelosi said in her own remarks to the chamber.She cited COVID safety concerns. Many lawmakers also remained home during a House recess. He briefly mentioned Democrats' voting rights push, pointing out how 'new laws are being written not to protect the vote, but to deny it.' Biden will travel to Georgia on Tuesday to give a broader voting rights address. 'The former president and his supporters, the only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert our elections,' Biden said. 'It's wrong. It's undemocratic, and frankly, it is un-American.' The 'second big lie,' Biden continued, was Trump telling his supporters the results of the 2020 election can't be trusted. 'The truth is that no election, no election in American history, has been more closely scrutinized or more carefully counted,' the president pointed out.   'He was just looking for an excuse, a pretext to cover for the truth,' Biden said. 'He is not just a former president, he is a defeated former president.' 'Defeated by a margin of over 7 million of your votes. In a full and free and fair election,' Biden continued. 'There is simply zero proof the election results were inaccurate.'   A 'third big lie,' Biden said, came when Trump and his supporters called the MAGA mob who stormed the Capitol 'the nation's true patriots.' 'Is that what you thought when you looked at the mob ransacking the capitol, destroying property, literally defecating in the hallways?' the president said. 'Going through the desks of senators and representative. Hunting down members of Congress.' 'Patriots?' Biden asked. 'Not in my view.' Biden said the true patriots were the country's voters, the election workers and law enforcement who defended the Capitol on January 6. 'You can't love your country only when you win,' he said. 'You can't obey the law only when it is convenient. You can't be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies.' Madam Vice President, my fellow Americans: To state the obvious, one year ago today, in this sacred place, democracy was attacked -- simply attacked. The will of the people was under assault. The Constitution -- our Constitution -- faced the gravest of threats.Outnumbered and in the face of a brutal attack, the Capitol Police, the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, the National Guard, and other brave law enforcement officials saved the rule of law.Our democracy held. We the people endured. And we the people prevailed.For the first time in our history, a president had not just lost an election, he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob breached the Capitol.But they failed. They failed.And on this day of remembrance, we must make sure that such an attack never, never happens again.I'm speaking to you today from Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol. This is where the House of Representativesmet for 50 years in the decades leading up to the Civil War. This is -- on this floor is where a young congressman of Illinois, Abraham Lincoln, sat at desk 191.Above him -- above us, over that door leading into the Rotunda -- is a sculpture depicting Clio, the muse of history. In her hands, an open book in which she records the events taking place in this chamber below.Clio stood watch over this hall one year ago today, as she has for more than 200 years. She recorded what took place. The real history. The real facts. The real truth. The factsand the truth that Vice President Harris just shared and that you and I and the whole world saw with our own eyes.The Bible tells us that we shall know the truth, and the truth shall make us free. We shall know the truth.Well, here is the God's truth about January 6th, 2021:Close your eyes. Go back to that day. What do you see? Rioters rampaging, waving for the first time inside this Capitol a Confederate flag that symbolized the cause to destroy America, to rip us apart.Even during the Civil War, that never, ever happened. But it happened here in 2021.What else do you see? A mob breaking windows, kicking in doors, breaching the Capitol. American flags on poles being used as weapons, as spears. Fire extinguishers being thrown at the heads of police officers.A crowd that professes their love for law enforcement assaulted those police officers, dragged them, sprayed them, stomped on them.Over 140 police officers were injured.We've all heard the police officers who were there that day testify to what happened. One officer called it, quote, a med- -- 'medieval' battle, and that he was more afraid that day than he was fighting the war in Iraq.They've repeatedly asked since that day: How dare anyone -- anyone -- diminish, belittle, or deny the hell they were put through?We saw it with our own eyes. Rioters menaced these halls, threatening the life of the Speaker of the House, literally erecting gallows to hang the Vice President of the United States of America.But what did we not see?We didn't see a former president, who had just rallied the mob to attack -- sitting in the private dining room off the Oval Office in the White House, watching it all on television and doing nothing for hours as police were assaulted, lives at risk, and the nation's capital under siege.This wasn't a group of tourists. This was an armed insurrection.They weren't looking to uphold the will of the people. They were looking to deny the will of the people.They were looking to uphold -- they weren't looking to uphold a free and fair election. They were looking to overturn one.They weren't looking to save the cause of America. They were looking to subvert the Constitution.This isn't about being bogged down in the past. This is about making sure the past isn't buried.That's the only way forward. That's what great nations do. They don't bury the truth, they face up to it. Sounds like hyperbole, but that's the truth: They face up to it.We are a great nation.My fellow Americans, in life, there's truth and,tragically, there are lies -- lies conceived and spread for profit and power.We must be absolutely clear about what is true and what is a lie.And here is the truth: The former president of theUnited States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election. He's done so because he values power over principle, because he sees his own interests as more important than his country's interests and America's interests, and because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution.He can't accept he lost, even though that's what 93 United States senators, his own Attorney General, his own Vice President, governors and state officials in every battleground state have all said: He lost.That's what 81 million of you did as you voted for a new way forward.He has done what no president in American history -- the history of this country -- has ever, ever done: He refused to accept the results of an election and the will of the American people.While some courageous men and women in the Republican Party are standing against it, trying to uphold the principles of that party, too many others are transforming that party into something else. They seem no longer to want to be the party -- the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Reagan, the Bushes.But whatever my other disagreements are with Republicans who support the rule of law and not the rule of a single man, I will always seek to work together with them to find shared solutions where possible. Because if we have a shared belief in democracy, then anything is possible -- anything.And so, at this moment, we must decide: What kind of nation are we going to be?Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm?Are we going to be a nation where we allow partisan election officials to overturn the legally expressed will of the people?Are we going to be a nation that lives not by the light of the truth but in the shadow of lies?We cannot allow ourselves to be that kind of nation. The way forward is to recognize the truth and to live by it.The Big Lie being told by the former president and many Republicans who fear his wrath is that the insurrection in this country actually took place on Election Day -- November 3rd, 2020.Think about that. Is that what you thought? Is that what you thought when you voted that day? Taking part in an insurrection? Is that what you thought you were doing? Or did you think you were carrying out your highest duty as a citizen and voting?The former president and his supporters are trying to rewrite history. They want you to see Election Day as the day of insurrection and the riot that took place here on January 6th as the true expression of the will of the people.Can you think of a more twisted way to look at this country -- to look at America? I cannot.Here's the truth: The election of 2020 was the greatest demonstration of democracy in the history of this country.More of you voted in that election than have ever voted in all of American history. Over 150 million Americans went to the polls and voted that day in a pandemic -- some at grea- -- great risk to their lives. They should be applauded, not attacked.Right now, in state after state, new laws are being written -- not to protect the vote, but to deny it; not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert it; not to strengthen or protect our democracy, but because the former president lost.Instead of looking at the election results from 2020 and saying they need new ideas or better ideas to win more votes, the former president and his supporters have decided the only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert our elections.It's wrong. It's undemocratic. And frankly, it's un-American.The second Big Lie being told by the former President and his supporters is that the results of the election of 2020 can't be trusted.The truth is that no election -- no election in American history has been more closely scrutinized or more carefully counted.Every legal challenge questioning the results in every court in this country that could have been made was made and was rejected -- often rejected by Republican-appointed judges, including judges appointed by the former president himself, from state courts to the United States Supreme Court.Recounts were undertaken in state after state. Georgia -- Georgia counted its results three times, with one recount by hand.Phony partisan audits were undertaken long after the election in several states. None changed the results. And in some of them, the irony is the margin of victory actually grew slightly.So, let's speak plainly about what happened in 2020. Even before the first ballot was cast, the former presidentwas preemptively sowing doubt about the election results. He built his lie over months. It wasn't based on any facts. He was just looking for an excuse -- a pretext -- to cover for the truth.He's not just a former president. He's a defeated former president -- defeated by a margin of over 7 million of your votes in a full and free and fair election.There is simply zero proof the election results were inaccurate. In fact, in every venue where evidence had to be produced and an oath to tell the truth had to be taken, the former president failed to make his case.Just think about this: The former president and his supporters have never been able to explain how they accept as accurate the other election results that took place on November 3rd -- the elections for governor, United States Senate, the House of Representatives -- elections in which they closed the gap in the House.They challenge none of that. The President's name was first, then we went down the line -- governors, senators, House of Representatives. Somehow, those results were accurate on the same ballot, but the presidential race was flawed?And on the same ballot, the same day, cast by the same voters.The only difference: The former President didn't lose those races; he just lost the one that was his own.Finally, the third Big Lie being told by a former President and his supporters is that the mob who sought to impose their will through violence are the nation's true patriots.Is that what you thought when you looked at the mob ransacking the Capitol, destroying property, literally defecating in the hallways, rifling through desks of senators and representatives, hunting down members of congress? Patriots? Not in my view.To me, the true patriots were the more than 150 [million] Americans who peacefully expressed their vote at the ballot box, the election workers who protected the integrity of the vote, and the heroes who defended this Capitol.You can't love your country only when you win.You can't obey the law only when it's convenient.You can't be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies.Those who stormed this Capitol and those who instigated and incited and those who called on them to do so held a dagger at the throat of America -- at American democracy.They didn't come here out of patriotism or principle. They came here in rage -- not in service of America, but rather in service of one man.Those who incited the mob -- the real plotters -- who were desperate to deny the certification of the election and defy the will of the voters.But their plot was foiled. Congressmen -- Democrats and Republicans -- stayed. Senators, representatives, staff -- they finished their work the Constitution demanded. They honored their oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.Look, folks, now it's up to all of us -- to 'We the People' -- to stand for the rule of law, to preserve the flame of democracy, to keep the promise of America alive.That promise is at risk, targeted by the forces that value brute strength over the sanctity of democracy, fear over hope, personal gain over public good.Make no mistake about it: We're living at an inflection point in history.Both at home and abroad, we're engaged anew in a struggle between democracy and autocracy, between the aspirations of the many and the greed of the few, between the people's right of self-determination and self- -- the self-seeking autocrat.From China to Russia and beyond, they're betting that democracy's days are numbered. They've actually told me democracy is too slow, too bogged down by division to succeed in today's rapidly changing, complicated world.And they're betting -- they're betting America will become more like them and less like us. They're betting that America is a place for the autocrat, the dictator, the strongman.I do not believe that. That is not who we are. That is not who we have ever been. And that is not who we should ever, ever be.Our Founding Fathers, as imperfect as they were, set in motion an experiment that changed the world -- literally changed the world.Here in America, the people would rule, power would be transferred peacefully -- never at the tip of a spear or the barrel of a gun.And they committed to paper an idea that couldn't live up to -- they couldn't live up to but an idea that couldn't be constrained: Yes, in America all people are created equal.We reject the view that if you succeed, I fail; if you get ahead, I fall behind; if I hold you down, I somehow lift myself up.The former President, who lies about this election, and the mob that attacked this Capitol could not be further away from the core American values.They want to rule or they will ruin -- ruin what our country fought for at Lexington and Concord; at Gettysburg; at Omaha Beach; Seneca Falls; Selma, Alabama. What -- and what we were fighting for: the right to vote, the right to govern ourselves, the right to determine our own destiny.And with rights come responsibilities: the responsibility to see each other as neighbors -- maybe we disagree with that neighbor, but they're not an adversary; the responsibility to accept defeat then get back in the arena and try again the next time to make your case; the responsibility to see that America is an idea -- an idea that requires vigilant stewardship.As we stand here today -- one year since January 6th, 2021 -- the lies that drove the anger and madness we saw in this place, they have not abated.So, we have to be firm, resolute, and unyielding in our defense of the right to vote and to have that vote counted.Some have already made the ultimate sacrifice in this sacred effort.Jill and I have mourned police officers in this Capitol Rotunda not once but twice in the wake of January 6th: once to honor Officer Brian Sicknick, who lost his life the day after the attack, and a second time to honor Officer Billy Evans, who lost his life defending this Capitol as well.We think about the others who lost their lives and were injured and everyone living with the trauma of that day -- from those defending this Capitol to members of Congress in both parties and their staffs, to reporters, cafeteria workers, custodial workers, and their families.Don't kid yourself: The pain and scars from that day run deep.I said it many times and it's no more true or real than when we think about the events of January 6th: We are in a battle for the soul of America. A battle that, by the grace of God and the goodness and gracious -- and greatness of this nation, we will win.Believe me, I know how difficult democracy is. And I'm crystal clear about the threats America faces. But I also know that our darkest days can lead to light and hope.From the death and destruction, as the Vice President referenced, in Pearl Harbor came the triumph over the forces of fascism.From the brutality of Bloody Sunday on the Edmund Pettus Bridge came historic voting rights legislation.So, now let us step up, write the next chapter in American history where January 6th marks not the end of democracy, but the beginning of a renaissance of liberty and fair play.I did not seek this fight brought to this Capitol one year ago today, but I will not shrink from it either.I will stand in this breach. I will defend this nation. And I will allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy.We will make sure the will of the people is heard; that the ballot prevails, not violence; that authority in this nation will always be peacefully transferred.I believe the power of the presidency and the purpose is to unite this nation, not divide it; to lift us up, not tear us apart; to be about us -- about us, not about 'me.'Deep in the heart of America burns a flame lit almost 250 years ago -- of liberty, freedom, and equality.This is not a land of kings or dictators or autocrats. We're a nation of laws; of order, not chaos; of peace, not violence.Here in America, the people rule through the ballot, and their will prevails.So, let us remember: Together, we're one nation, under God, indivisible; that today, tomorrow, and forever, at our best, we are the United States of America.God bless you all. May God protect our troops. And may God bless those who stand watch over our democracy.  ",0.116
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10376147/Lindsey-Graham-criticizes-Biden-brazen-politicization-January-6-speech-attacking-Trump.html,"GOP Senator Lindsey Graham accused President Joe Biden of 'brazenly' politicizing the Capitol riot on Thursday after he delivered a speech directly blaming his predecessor for the deadly events of January 6, 2021.The 79-year-old Democrat alongside Vice President Kamala Harris made a rare Capitol Hill address on Thursday morning to mark one year since Donald Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol complex to stop lawmakers from certifying Biden's 2020 electoral victory. 'The former president and his supporters are trying to rewrite history. They want you to see Election Day as the day of insurrection and the riot that took place here on January 6th as the true expression of the will of the people,' Biden said in his most severe condemnation of Trump while in office.Graham, one of the ex-president's closest allies in Congress, immediately tore into Biden on Twitter and pivoted to criticize him over the chaotic summer Afghanistan withdrawal.'What brazen politicization of January 6 by President Biden. I wonder if the Taliban who now rule Afghanistan with al-Qaeda elements present, contrary to President Biden’s beliefs, are allowing this speech to be carried?' Graham wrote. Shortly after Biden concluded his remarks the South Carolina senator took to Twitter again to express his residual shock and outrage at the deadly riot while equating it with left-wing activists' Black Lives Matter protests 'I still cannot believe a mob was able to take over the United States Capitol during such a pivotal moment – certifying a presidential election,' Graham said in a statement shortly after Biden concluded.'It would have been so easy for terrorists to boot strap onto this protest and wreak even further destruction on the U.S. Capitol.'He condemned those who took part in breaking into the Capitol and called for them to be 'prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.''I hold the same views of those who attacked the federal courthouse in Portland, Oregon and committed other acts of violence throughout our nation,' he added, recalling the millions of dollars of damage done to federal property by demonstrators protesting police violence.Graham continued his attacks against Biden and Harris, accusing them of using their speeches today for selfish purposes.'Finally, President Biden and Vice President Harris’s speeches today were an effort to resurrect a failed presidency more than marking the anniversary of a dark day in American history,' the Republican senator wrote.'The Biden Presidency, one year after January 6, is in free fall not because of the attack on our Capitol, but because of failed policies and weak leadership.'He and other lawmakers, along with their staff and members of the media, were forced to hide for hours on January 6 of last year while Trump's supporters carried confederate flags through the halls of Congress, attacked law enforcement -- some with their own weapons -- and even chanted 'Hang Mike Pence' after the former vice president refused to help Trump overturn his election loss.Graham claimed Congressional Democrats, who planned a solemn day of retrospection to mark one year since the insurrection, were using the politically charged riot to further Biden's agenda on voting rights and as an excuse to scuttle the filibuster.'Their brazen attempts to use January 6 to support radical election reform and changing the rules of the Senate to accomplish this goal, will not succeed,' Graham wrote on Twitter. 'The so-called voting rights acts they are pushing are a liberal Democrat federal takeover of our election systems which constitutionally reside with the states.'The Republican senator is himself under investigation in Georgia for alleged efforts to pressure election officials there. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger told the Washington Post in late 2020 that Graham called asking about circumstances in which he could simply toss large swaths of mail-in ballots over mismatched signature issues. Graham disputed the account. His criticism on Thursday was echoed by House GOP Whip Steve Scalise, who told Fox News that Democrats 'want every day to be about January 6' to avoid focusing on other issues plaguing the nation.'You know, it just is very clear: They want this to be [a] politicized day. Most of America doesn’t want it politicized,' Scalise said.'Most of America wants Washington focused on their problems like inflation, high gas prices, the COVID resurgence, the border crisis, which President Biden and Speaker Pelosi continue to just let go unanswered because they want every day to be about January 6.'Vice President Kamala Harris compared the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol one year ago to the bombing of Pearl Harbor and 9/11. 'Certain dates echo throughout history, including dates that instantly remind all who have lived through them where they were and what they were doing, when our democracy came under assault,' Harris began. 'December 7, 1941, September 11, 2001 and January 6, 2021.'Harris alluded to civil rights fights of the past century. 'What the extremists who roamed these halls targeted was not only the lives of elected leaders ... what they were assaulting were the institutions, the values, the ideals that generations of Americans have marched, picketed and shed blood to establish and defend.'  'We cannot let our future be decided by those bent on silencing our voices, overturning our votes, and peddling lies and misinformation by some radical faction that may be newly resurgent, but whose roots run old and deep.' Harris then called the U.S. the 'oldest and greatest democracy in the world.' 'I wonder, how will January 6 be come to be remembered?' Harris said. 'Will it be remembered as a moment that accelerated the unraveling of the oldest and greatest democracy in the world? Or a moment when we decided to secure and strengthen our democracy for generations to come?'Democracy was coined by the Greeks in 430 B.C., means 'for the people' and many communities such as Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the UK's Isle of Man, San Marino and Switzerland have had so-called democracies dating back to the ninth and tenth centuries. Biden opened his remarks on Thursday by acknowledging that his opponent's supporters breaking into the Capitol to stop the election certification amounted to an 'attack' on democracy. It wasn't long before his searing criticism of Trump for refusing to accept the 2020 election results and failing to act earlier to call off the mob.'For the first time in our history, a president had not just lost an election, he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob breached the Capitol. But they failed,' Biden said.'We saw it with our own eyes. Rioters menaced these halls, threatening the life of the Speaker of the House, literally erecting gallows to hang the Vice President of the United States of America. But what did we not see?'We didn’t see a former president, who had just rallied the mob to attack, sitting in the private dining room off the Oval Office in the White House, watching it all on television and doing nothing for hours as police were assaulted, lives at risk, and the nation’s capital under siege.'He directly accused Trump of fomenting 'a web of lies about the 2020 election.' 'He’s done so because he values power over principle, because he sees his own interests as more important than his country’s interests and America's interests, and because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution,' Biden said. In her speech preceding Biden's Harris compared January 6 to the devastating events of the Pearl Harbor attack and September 11.Not long after the president's remarks concluded, Trump released a lengthy statement claiming Biden was using his name to divide the country. In fact, despite mentioning the 'former president' more than a dozen times, Biden refrained from saying Trump's name even once.'Biden, who is destroying our Nation with insane policies of open Borders, corrupt Elections, disastrous energy policies, unconstitutional mandates, and devastating school closures, used my name today to try to further divide America,' Trump said in a statement through his Save America PAC.'This political theater is all just a distraction for the fact Biden has completely and totally failed.'He released a follow-up statement in the early afternoon appearing to express sympathy for those who broke into the Capitol last year.'To watch Biden speaking is very hurtful to many people. They're the ones who tried to stop the peaceful transfer with a rigged election,' Trump said.'America is a laughingstock stock of the world, and it's all because of the real insurrection, which took place on November 3rd, but this is an election year and MAGA Republicans should get elected and work with me to fix this horror that Joe Biden and the Democrats have brought us.'Madam Vice President, my fellow Americans: To state the obvious, one year ago today, in this sacred place, democracy was attacked -- simply attacked. The will of the people was under assault. The Constitution -- our Constitution -- faced the gravest of threats.Outnumbered and in the face of a brutal attack, the Capitol Police, the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, the National Guard, and other brave law enforcement officials saved the rule of law.Our democracy held. We the people endured. And we the people prevailed.For the first time in our history, a president had not just lost an election, he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob breached the Capitol.But they failed. They failed.And on this day of remembrance, we must make sure that such an attack never, never happens again.I'm speaking to you today from Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol. This is where the House of Representativesmet for 50 years in the decades leading up to the Civil War. This is -- on this floor is where a young congressman of Illinois, Abraham Lincoln, sat at desk 191.Above him -- above us, over that door leading into the Rotunda -- is a sculpture depicting Clio, the muse of history. In her hands, an open book in which she records the events taking place in this chamber below.Clio stood watch over this hall one year ago today, as she has for more than 200 years. She recorded what took place. The real history. The real facts. The real truth. The factsand the truth that Vice President Harris just shared and that you and I and the whole world saw with our own eyes.The Bible tells us that we shall know the truth, and the truth shall make us free. We shall know the truth.Well, here is the God's truth about January 6th, 2021:Close your eyes. Go back to that day. What do you see? Rioters rampaging, waving for the first time inside this Capitol a Confederate flag that symbolized the cause to destroy America, to rip us apart.Even during the Civil War, that never, ever happened. But it happened here in 2021.What else do you see? A mob breaking windows, kicking in doors, breaching the Capitol. American flags on poles being used as weapons, as spears. Fire extinguishers being thrown at the heads of police officers.A crowd that professes their love for law enforcement assaulted those police officers, dragged them, sprayed them, stomped on them.Over 140 police officers were injured.We've all heard the police officers who were there that day testify to what happened. One officer called it, quote, a med- -- 'medieval' battle, and that he was more afraid that day than he was fighting the war in Iraq.They've repeatedly asked since that day: How dare anyone -- anyone -- diminish, belittle, or deny the hell they were put through?We saw it with our own eyes. Rioters menaced these halls, threatening the life of the Speaker of the House, literally erecting gallows to hang the Vice President of the United States of America.But what did we not see?We didn't see a former president, who had just rallied the mob to attack -- sitting in the private dining room off the Oval Office in the White House, watching it all on television and doing nothing for hours as police were assaulted, lives at risk, and the nation's capital under siege.This wasn't a group of tourists. This was an armed insurrection.They weren't looking to uphold the will of the people. They were looking to deny the will of the people.They were looking to uphold -- they weren't looking to uphold a free and fair election. They were looking to overturn one.They weren't looking to save the cause of America. They were looking to subvert the Constitution.This isn't about being bogged down in the past. This is about making sure the past isn't buried.That's the only way forward. That's what great nations do. They don't bury the truth, they face up to it. Sounds like hyperbole, but that's the truth: They face up to it.We are a great nation.My fellow Americans, in life, there's truth and,tragically, there are lies -- lies conceived and spread for profit and power.We must be absolutely clear about what is true and what is a lie.And here is the truth: The former president of theUnited States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election. He's done so because he values power over principle, because he sees his own interests as more important than his country's interests and America's interests, and because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution.He can't accept he lost, even though that's what 93 United States senators, his own Attorney General, his own Vice President, governors and state officials in every battleground state have all said: He lost.That's what 81 million of you did as you voted for a new way forward.He has done what no president in American history -- the history of this country -- has ever, ever done: He refused to accept the results of an election and the will of the American people.While some courageous men and women in the Republican Party are standing against it, trying to uphold the principles of that party, too many others are transforming that party into something else. They seem no longer to want to be the party -- the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Reagan, the Bushes.But whatever my other disagreements are with Republicans who support the rule of law and not the rule of a single man, I will always seek to work together with them to find shared solutions where possible. Because if we have a shared belief in democracy, then anything is possible -- anything.And so, at this moment, we must decide: What kind of nation are we going to be?Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm?Are we going to be a nation where we allow partisan election officials to overturn the legally expressed will of the people?Are we going to be a nation that lives not by the light of the truth but in the shadow of lies?We cannot allow ourselves to be that kind of nation. The way forward is to recognize the truth and to live by it.The Big Lie being told by the former president and many Republicans who fear his wrath is that the insurrection in this country actually took place on Election Day -- November 3rd, 2020.Think about that. Is that what you thought? Is that what you thought when you voted that day? Taking part in an insurrection? Is that what you thought you were doing? Or did you think you were carrying out your highest duty as a citizen and voting?The former president and his supporters are trying to rewrite history. They want you to see Election Day as the day of insurrection and the riot that took place here on January 6th as the true expression of the will of the people.Can you think of a more twisted way to look at this country -- to look at America? I cannot.Here's the truth: The election of 2020 was the greatest demonstration of democracy in the history of this country.More of you voted in that election than have ever voted in all of American history. Over 150 million Americans went to the polls and voted that day in a pandemic -- some at grea- -- great risk to their lives. They should be applauded, not attacked.Right now, in state after state, new laws are being written -- not to protect the vote, but to deny it; not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert it; not to strengthen or protect our democracy, but because the former president lost.Instead of looking at the election results from 2020 and saying they need new ideas or better ideas to win more votes, the former president and his supporters have decided the only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert our elections.It's wrong. It's undemocratic. And frankly, it's un-American.The second Big Lie being told by the former President and his supporters is that the results of the election of 2020 can't be trusted.The truth is that no election -- no election in American history has been more closely scrutinized or more carefully counted.Every legal challenge questioning the results in every court in this country that could have been made was made and was rejected -- often rejected by Republican-appointed judges, including judges appointed by the former president himself, from state courts to the United States Supreme Court.Recounts were undertaken in state after state. Georgia -- Georgia counted its results three times, with one recount by hand.Phony partisan audits were undertaken long after the election in several states. None changed the results. And in some of them, the irony is the margin of victory actually grew slightly.So, let's speak plainly about what happened in 2020. Even before the first ballot was cast, the former presidentwas preemptively sowing doubt about the election results. He built his lie over months. It wasn't based on any facts. He was just looking for an excuse -- a pretext -- to cover for the truth.He's not just a former president. He's a defeated former president -- defeated by a margin of over 7 million of your votes in a full and free and fair election.There is simply zero proof the election results were inaccurate. In fact, in every venue where evidence had to be produced and an oath to tell the truth had to be taken, the former president failed to make his case.Just think about this: The former president and his supporters have never been able to explain how they accept as accurate the other election results that took place on November 3rd -- the elections for governor, United States Senate, the House of Representatives -- elections in which they closed the gap in the House.They challenge none of that. The President's name was first, then we went down the line -- governors, senators, House of Representatives. Somehow, those results were accurate on the same ballot, but the presidential race was flawed?And on the same ballot, the same day, cast by the same voters.The only difference: The former President didn't lose those races; he just lost the one that was his own.Finally, the third Big Lie being told by a former President and his supporters is that the mob who sought to impose their will through violence are the nation's true patriots.Is that what you thought when you looked at the mob ransacking the Capitol, destroying property, literally defecating in the hallways, rifling through desks of senators and representatives, hunting down members of congress? Patriots? Not in my view.To me, the true patriots were the more than 150 [million] Americans who peacefully expressed their vote at the ballot box, the election workers who protected the integrity of the vote, and the heroes who defended this Capitol.You can't love your country only when you win.You can't obey the law only when it's convenient.You can't be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies.Those who stormed this Capitol and those who instigated and incited and those who called on them to do so held a dagger at the throat of America -- at American democracy.They didn't come here out of patriotism or principle. They came here in rage -- not in service of America, but rather in service of one man.Those who incited the mob -- the real plotters -- who were desperate to deny the certification of the election and defy the will of the voters.But their plot was foiled. Congressmen -- Democrats and Republicans -- stayed. Senators, representatives, staff -- they finished their work the Constitution demanded. They honored their oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.Look, folks, now it's up to all of us -- to 'We the People' -- to stand for the rule of law, to preserve the flame of democracy, to keep the promise of America alive.That promise is at risk, targeted by the forces that value brute strength over the sanctity of democracy, fear over hope, personal gain over public good.Make no mistake about it: We're living at an inflection point in history.Both at home and abroad, we're engaged anew in a struggle between democracy and autocracy, between the aspirations of the many and the greed of the few, between the people's right of self-determination and self- -- the self-seeking autocrat.From China to Russia and beyond, they're betting that democracy's days are numbered. They've actually told me democracy is too slow, too bogged down by division to succeed in today's rapidly changing, complicated world.And they're betting -- they're betting America will become more like them and less like us. They're betting that America is a place for the autocrat, the dictator, the strongman.I do not believe that. That is not who we are. That is not who we have ever been. And that is not who we should ever, ever be.Our Founding Fathers, as imperfect as they were, set in motion an experiment that changed the world -- literally changed the world.Here in America, the people would rule, power would be transferred peacefully -- never at the tip of a spear or the barrel of a gun.And they committed to paper an idea that couldn't live up to -- they couldn't live up to but an idea that couldn't be constrained: Yes, in America all people are created equal.We reject the view that if you succeed, I fail; if you get ahead, I fall behind; if I hold you down, I somehow lift myself up.The former President, who lies about this election, and the mob that attacked this Capitol could not be further away from the core American values.They want to rule or they will ruin -- ruin what our country fought for at Lexington and Concord; at Gettysburg; at Omaha Beach; Seneca Falls; Selma, Alabama. What -- and what we were fighting for: the right to vote, the right to govern ourselves, the right to determine our own destiny.And with rights come responsibilities: the responsibility to see each other as neighbors -- maybe we disagree with that neighbor, but they're not an adversary; the responsibility to accept defeat then get back in the arena and try again the next time to make your case; the responsibility to see that America is an idea -- an idea that requires vigilant stewardship.As we stand here today -- one year since January 6th, 2021 -- the lies that drove the anger and madness we saw in this place, they have not abated.So, we have to be firm, resolute, and unyielding in our defense of the right to vote and to have that vote counted.Some have already made the ultimate sacrifice in this sacred effort.Jill and I have mourned police officers in this Capitol Rotunda not once but twice in the wake of January 6th: once to honor Officer Brian Sicknick, who lost his life the day after the attack, and a second time to honor Officer Billy Evans, who lost his life defending this Capitol as well.We think about the others who lost their lives and were injured and everyone living with the trauma of that day -- from those defending this Capitol to members of Congress in both parties and their staffs, to reporters, cafeteria workers, custodial workers, and their families.Don't kid yourself: The pain and scars from that day run deep.I said it many times and it's no more true or real than when we think about the events of January 6th: We are in a battle for the soul of America. A battle that, by the grace of God and the goodness and gracious -- and greatness of this nation, we will win.Believe me, I know how difficult democracy is. And I'm crystal clear about the threats America faces. But I also know that our darkest days can lead to light and hope.From the death and destruction, as the Vice President referenced, in Pearl Harbor came the triumph over the forces of fascism.From the brutality of Bloody Sunday on the Edmund Pettus Bridge came historic voting rights legislation.So, now let us step up, write the next chapter in American history where January 6th marks not the end of democracy, but the beginning of a renaissance of liberty and fair play.I did not seek this fight brought to this Capitol one year ago today, but I will not shrink from it either.I will stand in this breach. I will defend this nation. And I will allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy.We will make sure the will of the people is heard; that the ballot prevails, not violence; that authority in this nation will always be peacefully transferred.I believe the power of the presidency and the purpose is to unite this nation, not divide it; to lift us up, not tear us apart; to be about us -- about us, not about 'me.'Deep in the heart of America burns a flame lit almost 250 years ago -- of liberty, freedom, and equality.This is not a land of kings or dictators or autocrats. We're a nation of laws; of order, not chaos; of peace, not violence.Here in America, the people rule through the ballot, and their will prevails.So, let us remember: Together, we're one nation, under God, indivisible; that today, tomorrow, and forever, at our best, we are the United States of America.God bless you all. May God protect our troops. And may God bless those who stand watch over our democracy.  ",0.114

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Rudy Giuliani.  The Comedy Central show, hosted by Trevor Noah, unveiled the display in Manhattan's Flatiron District on Thursday, which also marked one year of the deadly attack.The temporary installation is comprised of eight stone markers featuring plaques with the faces of prominent GOP figures, including Republican Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.) and Lauren Boebert (Colo.), Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Fox News host Tucker Carlson and former White House strategist Steve Bannon.Beneath Trump's image, the description reads that 'no hero player a bigger part in the Freedomsurrection' than the 45th president himself. 'Though to humble to willingly release documents detailing the full scope of his efforts to stop the tyrannical will of the the people, we do know he fought tirelessly to install turnover-friendly allies in the Justice Department, and directed officials to “just say that the election was corrupt” and “leave the rest to me.” While his efforts were not enough to keep him in the White House, his bravery on January 6 will never be forgotten, unless Republicans retake Congress and disband the committees investigating it.'  Another plaque features Cruz's face and reads that he 'rallied the troops with all his natural charisma and oozing likeability.' The monument is located at 23rd Street and Broadway in Manhattan's Flatiron District, and will be on display Thursday until 11 p.m.  The Daily Show asks that they not be torn down, 'because history.'In a speech Thursday, President Joe Biden tore into former President Donald Trump for watching TV while a mob stormed the Capitol on January 6, mocked his 'bruised ego' and accused him and his supporters of holding a 'dagger in the throat of democracy.' In his most searing attack on his predecessor to date, Biden called Trump a 'defeated former president' and criticized him for 'refusing to accept he lost' the November 2020 in remarks on the one-year anniversary of the attack alongside Kamala Harris.'We saw with our own eyes rioters menace these halls, threatening the life of the Speaker of the House. Literally erecting gallows to hang the vice president of the United States of America,' Biden recalled. 'What did we not see? We didn't see a former president, who just rallied the mob to attack, sitting in a private dining room off the Oval Office in the White House watching it all on television and doing nothing for hours.'  Biden went after the MAGA mob saying: 'This wasn't a group of tourists. This was an armed insurrection.'He did not mention his predecessor by name but - 16 times - referred to him as 'the former president,' accusing Trump of creating and spreading 'a web of lies about the 2020 election.' Trump called Biden's speech 'political theater' and a distraction for his failures in a statement shortly after Biden finished, and doubled down on his false claim he won the 2020 election and the result was rigged.Biden's speech was filled with descriptive phrases: Trump's 'bruised ego' and 'web of lies.'

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10376145/Biden-says-didnt-Trump-avoid-contemporary-political-battle.html,"President Joe Biden said he didn't mention his predecessor Donald Trump by name in his speech marking the one-year anniversary of the January 6th riot because he didn't want to start a 'contemporary political battle.''I did not want to turn it into a contemporary political battle between me and the president. It's way beyond that. It's way beyond that,' he said in response to a question from DailyMail.com in the halls of the Capitol after his remarks.He also said he was concerned about a new attitude in politics of it's all about me.'That's the thing that bothers me most about the sort of attitude that seems to be emerging to some degree in American politics. It's not about you, it's about me. That's how it's viewed. But it's not about me,' he said. He also said the nation needs to look to move on.'The way you have to heal you have to recognize the extend of the wound. You can't pretend. This is serious stuff. And a lot of people - understandably - want to go I’d just as soon not face it. You gotta face it. That’s what great nations do. They face the truth. Deal with it. And move on,' he said. In his speech Biden mentioned his predecessor or former president 16 times - but he never said Trump's name.Additionally, his remarks come at the start of 2022, the year of a midterm election where Republicans are looking to retake control of Congress and Trump is playing a kingmaker role in that party.In his response, Trump called Biden's speech 'political theater' and a distraction for his failures and doubled down on his false claim he won the 2020 election and the result was rigged.'This political theater is all just a distraction for the fact Biden has completely and totally failed,' Trump wrote in a statement. 'The Democrats want to own this day of January 6th so they can stoke fears and divide America,' he added. 'I say, let them have it because America sees through theirs [sic] lies and polarizations.' 'They spread a 'web of lies' about me and Russia for 4 years to try to overturn the 2016 election, and now they lie about how they interfered in the 2020 Election, too,' he said noted in one of his three statements released Thursday. The 2022 midterm is widely expected to be a referendum on Biden's presidency and most presidents see their party lose control of Congress. And Trump is expected to play an oversized role in Republican primaries as he seeks vengeance against any Republican lawmaker that voted to impeach him after the January 6th riot. Biden's approval ratings, meanwhile, have hit a low point - hovering in the lower 40s. Previously, officials in the Biden administration rarely mentioned Donald Trump, not wanting to get drawn into a verbal battle with the former president who was falsely claiming he was the real 2020 victor.'We would argue the point that he's ever shied away from making clear' that Trump 'posed a threat to him democracy throughout the course of his presidency, and that was a root reason why President Biden ran for office,' White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in her press briefing on Thursday.Psaki brushed off Trump's response to Biden's remarks, saying she was glad Trump watched the speech. 'Maybe he learned something,' she said. 'It looks like he saw the speech, I guess that's good news. Maybe he learned something about what it looks like to meet the moment in the country,' she said. Psaki also went after Republican lawmakers, saying they 'need to take a look at themselves and think about what role they want to play in the history books. When their children and grandchildren look at the history books. Do they want to be perpetuating the big lie? Do they want to be walking like the silent lemmings behind the former president?'And even if Biden said he didn't want the day to be about contemporary politics, Republicans charged the president and his party with turning the anniversary into just that. The GOP also accused them of trying to use the occasion to jam through legislation on voting rights. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham accused Biden of 'brazen politicization' and called the speech an 'effort to resurrect a failed presidency.In his nearly 25-minute speech, Biden tore into Trump for watching TV while a mob stormed the Capitol on January 6, mocked his 'bruised ego' and accused him and his supporters of holding a 'dagger in the throat of democracy' in a speech on Thursday.In his most searing attack on his predecessor to date, Biden called Trump a 'defeated former president' and criticized him for 'refusing to accept he lost' the November 2020 in remarks on the one-year anniversary of the attack alongside Kamala Harris.'We saw with our own eyes rioters menace these halls, threatening the life of the Speaker of the House. Literally erecting gallows to hang the vice president of the United States of America,' Biden recalled. 'What did we not see? We didn't see a former president, who just rallied the mob to attack, sitting in a private dining room off the Oval Office in the White House watching it all on television and doing nothing for hours.'    Biden went after the MAGA mob saying: 'This wasn't a group of tourists. This was an armed insurrection.' He did not mention his predecessor by name but - 16 times - referred to him as 'the former president,' accusing Trump of creating and spreading 'a web of lies about the 2020 election.'Before Biden spoke, Kamala Harris compared January 6 to 9/11 and the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, called America the 'oldest and greatest democracy in the world' and slammed the 'extremists' who stormed the Capitol. Biden's speech was filled with descriptive phrases: Trump's 'bruised ego' and 'web of lies.' He decried the rioters for 'ransacking the capitol, destroying property, literally defecating in the hallways?'   In his remarks, Biden essentially called the former president a 'loser,' which will likely infuriate Trump. 'Because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution,' Biden stated. 'He can't accept he lost.' Vice President Kamala Harris compared the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol one year ago to the bombing of Pearl Harbor and 9/11. 'Certain dates echo throughout history, including dates that instantly remind all who have lived through them where they were and what they were doing, when our democracy came under assault,' Harris began. 'December 7, 1941, September 11, 2001 and January 6, 2021.'Harris alluded to civil rights fights of the past century. 'What the extremists who roamed these halls targeted was not only the lives of elected leaders... what they were assaulting were the institutions, the values, the ideals that generations of Americans have marched, picketed and shed blood to establish and defend.'  'We cannot let our future be decided by those bent on silencing our voices, overturning our votes, and peddling lies and misinformation by some radical faction that may be newly resurgent, but whose roots run old and deep.' Harris then called the U.S. the 'oldest and greatest democracy in the world.' 'I wonder, how will January 6 be come to be remembered?' Harris said. 'Will it be remembered as a moment that accelerated the unraveling of the oldest and greatest democracy in the world? Or a moment when we decided to secure and strengthen our democracy for generations to come?'Democracy was coined by the Greeks in 430 B.C., means 'for the people' and many communities such as Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the UK's Isle of Man, San Marino and Switzerland have had so-called democracies dating back to the ninth and tenth centuries. He also charged that Trump continues the lie he won the election 'because he values power over principle. Because he sees his own interest as more important than his country's interest, than America's interest,' Biden said.  Trump said in his response: 'Biden is working hard to try and deflect the incompetent job he is doing, and has done, on the horrible Afghanistan withdrawal (surrender), the Borders, COVID, Inflation, loss of Energy Independence, and much more. Everything he touches turns to failure. That's what you get when you have a rigged Election.' In his speech, delivered in a nearly empty room, Biden spoke at length about the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election, offering his most detailed defense to date of his victory, which comes as Trump has continued to spout the so-called 'big lie,' that he lost out on a second term due to widespread election fraud. 'The big lie being told by the former president and many Republicans who fear his wrath is that the insurrection in this country actually took place on election day November 3, 2020,' Biden noted. The president said that Trump and his supporters are trying to 're-write history.' 'That the riot that took place on January 6 is a true expression of the will of the people. Can you think of a more twisted way to look at this country, to look at America?' Biden asked. 'I cannot.'   'Over 150 million Americans went to the polls and voted that day. In a pandemic. Some at great risk to their lives. They should be applauded not attacked,' the president added. He briefly mentioned Democrats' voting rights push, pointing out how 'new laws are being written not to protect the vote, but to deny it.' Biden will travel to Georgia on Tuesday to give a broader voting rights address. 'The former president and his supporters, the only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert our elections,' Biden said. 'It's wrong. It's undemocratic, and frankly, it is un-American.' The 'second big lie,' Biden continued, was Trump telling his supporters the results of the 2020 election can't be trusted. 'The truth is that no election, no election in American history, has been more closely scrutinized or more carefully counted,' the president pointed out.   'He was just looking for an excuse, a pretext to cover for the truth,' Biden said. 'He is not just a former president, he is a defeated former president.' 'Defeated by a margin of over 7 million of your votes. In a full and free and fair election,' Biden continued. 'There is simply zero proof the election results were inaccurate.'   A 'third big lie,' Biden said, came when Trump and his supporters called the MAGA mob who stormed the Capitol 'the nation's true patriots.' 'Is that what you thought when you looked at the mob ransacking the capitol, destroying property, literally defecating in the hallways?' the president said. 'Going through the desks of senators and representative. Hunting down members of Congress.' 'Patriots?' Biden asked. 'Not in my view.' Biden said the true patriots were the country's voters, the election workers and law enforcement who defended the Capitol on January 6. 'You can't love your country only when you win,' he said. 'You can't obey the law only when it is convenient. You can't be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies.' Biden never used Trump's name during the Thursday morning address, instead referring to him as 'the former president.' 'I didn't want to make it a contemporary political battle,' Biden told reporters after he concluded his speech.  In a statement after Biden's speech, Trump again called the election 'rigged' and repeated 'the Big Lie was the Election itself.' 'This political theater is all just a distraction for the fact Biden has completely and totally failed,' Trump added, pointing to inflation, Afghanistan, the migrant crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border and the continued coronavirus pandemic, including school closures. The Capitol building was quiet Thursday morning as Democrats prepared to spend the day in remembrance. There was a heavy police presence and several metal interlocking barricades surrounding the building. Snow was on the ground from the storm earlier in the week. FIRST STATEMENT - 10:00AM: Biden, who is destroying our Nation with insane policies of open Borders, corrupt Elections, disastrous energy policies, unconstitutional mandates, and devastating school closures, used my name today to try to further divide America. This political theater is all just a distraction for the fact Biden has completely and totally failed. Our Country no longer has Borders, has totally and completely lost control of Covid (record numbers!), is no longer Energy Independent, Inflation is rampant, our Military is in chaos, and our exit, or surrender, from Afghanistan was perhaps the most embarrassing day in the long and distinguished history of the United States—and so much more. Why is it that the Unselect Committee of totally partisan political hacks, whose judgment has long ago been made, not discussing the rigged Presidential Election of 2020? It's because they don't have the answers or justifications for what happened. They got away with something, and it is leading to our Country's destruction. They want all conversation concerning the Election 'Canceled.' Just look at the numbers, they speak for themselves. They are not justifiable, so the complicit media just calls it the Big Lie, when in actuality the Big Lie was the Election itself.The Democrats want to own this day of January 6th so they can stoke fears and divide America. I say, let them have it because America sees through theirs lies and polarizations.SECOND STATEMENT- 10.12AM: Biden is working hard to try and deflect the incompetent job he is doing, and has done, on the horrible Afghanistan withdrawal (surrender), the Borders, COVID, Inflation, loss of Energy Independence, and much more. Everything he touches turns to failure. That's what you get when you have a rigged Election. THIRD STATEMENT -  12.39AM: To watch Biden speaking is very hurtful to many people. They're the ones who tried to stop the peaceful transfer with a rigged election. Just look at the numbers. Does anybody really think that Biden beat Obama with the Black population in select Swing State cities, but nowhere else? That he would lose 18 out of 19 bellwether counties, and 27 out of 27 'toss up' House races, but somehow miraculously receive the most votes in American history with no coattails? That he would lose Florida, Ohio, and Iowa and win, even though it has never been done before? They spread a 'web of lies' about me and Russia for 4 years to try to overturn the 2016 election, and now they lie about how they interfered in the 2020 Election, too. Big Tech was used illegally. Where did all those votes show up from in Georgia, where it was just revealed they sold ballots for $10 a piece, or in Pennsylvania, and Arizona, and Wisconsin. He acts like he's aggrieved, but we're the ones who were aggrieved and America is suffering because of it with poisonous Borders, record Inflation, a humiliating surrender in Afghanistan, $5 a gallon gas and higher, empty stock shelves, and rampant crime. America is a laughingstock stock of the world, and it's all because of the real insurrection, which took place on November 3rd, but this is an election year and MAGA Republicans should get elected and work with me to fix this horror that Joe Biden and the Democrats have brought us.Never forget the crime of the 2020 Presidential Election. Never give up!Upon arriving at the Capitol, the president told reporters, 'I'm praying that we never have another day like we had a year ago today. That's what I'm praying.' He was escorted into the building by Democratic leaders, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Republicans have accused Democrats of playing politics with the anniversary.Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell called January 6 a 'dark day' in a statement but then pivoted to attacking Democrats for trying to change Senate rules in order to pass voting rights legislation.'It has been stunning to see some Washington Democrats try to exploit this anniversary to advance partisan policy goals that long predated this event,' McConnell said. 'It is especially jaw-dropping to hear some Senate Democrats invoke the mob's attempt to disrupt our country's norms, rules, and institutions as a justification to discard our norms, rules, and institutions themselves.' Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close friend to Trump, reacted to Biden's speech by saying, 'What brazen politicization of January 6 by President Biden.' 'I wonder if the Taliban who now rule Afghanistan with al-Qaeda elements present, contrary to President Biden's beliefs, are allowing this speech to be carried?' Graham added. Trump was supposed to address reporters Thursday from his Mar-a-Lago resort, but called off the press conference Tuesday night. The Biden administration has been reluctant to directly discuss Trump particularly given that the former president continues the false claim that he won the 2020 presidential election.But White House press secretary  Psaki did not mince words in her press briefing Wednesday about the administration's view of Trump. The former president addressed his supporters outside the White House on January 6, 2021 before they marched on the Capitol and tried to stop the certification of Biden's victory. House Democrats impeached Trump for his role but he was acquitted by the Senate. Biden has been 'clear eyed about the threat the former president represents to our democracy and how the former president constantly works to constantly undermine basic American values and rule of law,' Psaki said. She noted that Biden sees January 6th as a 'tragic culmination of what those four years under President Trump did to our country.'    In a bid capitalize on the anniversary, Democrats on committee are looking to crank up the pace of their probe and draw a massive audience with prime-time hearings. 'I have favored this strategy from the beginning,' Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, a member of the panel, told MSNBC's Morning Joe on Wednesday. He said he wanted a Watergate-style approach, when the 1973 hearings into Richard Nixon's presidency captivated America. At one point an estimated 85% of the country was tuned in to them.'I remember as a kid getting to watch a bit of the Watergate hearings, which were a daily spectacle that the whole country tuned into,' Raskin said. 'If we can do that for, you know, a break-in in a couple of offices in the Watergate hotel, certainly, we can do it for a massive break-in into the Capitol of the United States, a storming, and a seizure essentially of our government offices, an interruption of the peaceful transfer of power.'Those prime-time hearings could occur in late March or early April, Rep. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, told Bloomberg News.But no date has been set yet. 'We're working toward that,' Thompson said. Those hearings would also feature high-profile witnesses, which would help them gain maximum exposure. Among those names being considered are former Vice President Mike Pence.Pence was under heavy pressure from Trump to declare the 2020 election results invalid, wipe out Joe Biden's victory and secure him a second term. The vice president has the symbolic role of presiding over the Electoral College certification of results. Pence was a target of the January 6th rioters, some of who threatened to hang him, and was evacuated from the Senate floor as the MAGA supporters stormed the Capitol.Thompson told CNN that he and the panel would like to hear from Pence.'I would hope that he would do the right thing and come forward and voluntarily talk to the committee,' he said.'We have not formally asked. But if he offered, we'd gladly accept. Everything is under consideration,' he added. So far, in its investigation, the committee has interviewed more than 300 witnesses, announced more than 50 subpoenas, obtained more than 35,000 pages of records and received hundreds of telephone tips through their Jan. 6 tipline, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Names are starting to be lined up for hearings.  Madam Vice President, my fellow Americans: To state the obvious, one year ago today, in this sacred place, democracy was attacked -- simply attacked. The will of the people was under assault. The Constitution -- our Constitution -- faced the gravest of threats.Outnumbered and in the face of a brutal attack, the Capitol Police, the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, the National Guard, and other brave law enforcement officials saved the rule of law.Our democracy held. We the people endured. And we the people prevailed.For the first time in our history, a president had not just lost an election, he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob breached the Capitol.But they failed. They failed.And on this day of remembrance, we must make sure that such an attack never, never happens again.I'm speaking to you today from Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol. This is where the House of Representativesmet for 50 years in the decades leading up to the Civil War. This is -- on this floor is where a young congressman of Illinois, Abraham Lincoln, sat at desk 191.Above him -- above us, over that door leading into the Rotunda -- is a sculpture depicting Clio, the muse of history. In her hands, an open book in which she records the events taking place in this chamber below.Clio stood watch over this hall one year ago today, as she has for more than 200 years. She recorded what took place. The real history. The real facts. The real truth. The factsand the truth that Vice President Harris just shared and that you and I and the whole world saw with our own eyes.The Bible tells us that we shall know the truth, and the truth shall make us free. We shall know the truth.Well, here is the God's truth about January 6th, 2021:Close your eyes. Go back to that day. What do you see? Rioters rampaging, waving for the first time inside this Capitol a Confederate flag that symbolized the cause to destroy America, to rip us apart.Even during the Civil War, that never, ever happened. But it happened here in 2021.What else do you see? A mob breaking windows, kicking in doors, breaching the Capitol. American flags on poles being used as weapons, as spears. Fire extinguishers being thrown at the heads of police officers.A crowd that professes their love for law enforcement assaulted those police officers, dragged them, sprayed them, stomped on them.Over 140 police officers were injured.We've all heard the police officers who were there that day testify to what happened. One officer called it, quote, a med- -- 'medieval' battle, and that he was more afraid that day than he was fighting the war in Iraq.They've repeatedly asked since that day: How dare anyone -- anyone -- diminish, belittle, or deny the hell they were put through?We saw it with our own eyes. Rioters menaced these halls, threatening the life of the Speaker of the House, literally erecting gallows to hang the Vice President of the United States of America.But what did we not see?We didn't see a former president, who had just rallied the mob to attack -- sitting in the private dining room off the Oval Office in the White House, watching it all on television and doing nothing for hours as police were assaulted, lives at risk, and the nation's capital under siege.This wasn't a group of tourists. This was an armed insurrection.They weren't looking to uphold the will of the people. They were looking to deny the will of the people.They were looking to uphold -- they weren't looking to uphold a free and fair election. They were looking to overturn one.They weren't looking to save the cause of America. They were looking to subvert the Constitution.This isn't about being bogged down in the past. This is about making sure the past isn't buried.That's the only way forward. That's what great nations do. They don't bury the truth, they face up to it. Sounds like hyperbole, but that's the truth: They face up to it.We are a great nation.My fellow Americans, in life, there's truth and,tragically, there are lies -- lies conceived and spread for profit and power.We must be absolutely clear about what is true and what is a lie.And here is the truth: The former president of theUnited States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election. He's done so because he values power over principle, because he sees his own interests as more important than his country's interests and America's interests, and because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution.He can't accept he lost, even though that's what 93 United States senators, his own Attorney General, his own Vice President, governors and state officials in every battleground state have all said: He lost.That's what 81 million of you did as you voted for a new way forward.He has done what no president in American history -- the history of this country -- has ever, ever done: He refused to accept the results of an election and the will of the American people.While some courageous men and women in the Republican Party are standing against it, trying to uphold the principles of that party, too many others are transforming that party into something else. They seem no longer to want to be the party -- the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Reagan, the Bushes.But whatever my other disagreements are with Republicans who support the rule of law and not the rule of a single man, I will always seek to work together with them to find shared solutions where possible. Because if we have a shared belief in democracy, then anything is possible -- anything.And so, at this moment, we must decide: What kind of nation are we going to be?Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm?Are we going to be a nation where we allow partisan election officials to overturn the legally expressed will of the people?Are we going to be a nation that lives not by the light of the truth but in the shadow of lies?We cannot allow ourselves to be that kind of nation. The way forward is to recognize the truth and to live by it.The Big Lie being told by the former president and many Republicans who fear his wrath is that the insurrection in this country actually took place on Election Day -- November 3rd, 2020.Think about that. Is that what you thought? Is that what you thought when you voted that day? Taking part in an insurrection? Is that what you thought you were doing? Or did you think you were carrying out your highest duty as a citizen and voting?The former president and his supporters are trying to rewrite history. They want you to see Election Day as the day of insurrection and the riot that took place here on January 6th as the true expression of the will of the people.Can you think of a more twisted way to look at this country -- to look at America? I cannot.Here's the truth: The election of 2020 was the greatest demonstration of democracy in the history of this country.More of you voted in that election than have ever voted in all of American history. Over 150 million Americans went to the polls and voted that day in a pandemic -- some at grea- -- great risk to their lives. They should be applauded, not attacked.Right now, in state after state, new laws are being written -- not to protect the vote, but to deny it; not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert it; not to strengthen or protect our democracy, but because the former president lost.Instead of looking at the election results from 2020 and saying they need new ideas or better ideas to win more votes, the former president and his supporters have decided the only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert our elections.It's wrong. It's undemocratic. And frankly, it's un-American.The second Big Lie being told by the former President and his supporters is that the results of the election of 2020 can't be trusted.The truth is that no election -- no election in American history has been more closely scrutinized or more carefully counted.Every legal challenge questioning the results in every court in this country that could have been made was made and was rejected -- often rejected by Republican-appointed judges, including judges appointed by the former president himself, from state courts to the United States Supreme Court.Recounts were undertaken in state after state. Georgia -- Georgia counted its results three times, with one recount by hand.Phony partisan audits were undertaken long after the election in several states. None changed the results. And in some of them, the irony is the margin of victory actually grew slightly.So, let's speak plainly about what happened in 2020. Even before the first ballot was cast, the former presidentwas preemptively sowing doubt about the election results. He built his lie over months. It wasn't based on any facts. He was just looking for an excuse -- a pretext -- to cover for the truth.He's not just a former president. He's a defeated former president -- defeated by a margin of over 7 million of your votes in a full and free and fair election.There is simply zero proof the election results were inaccurate. In fact, in every venue where evidence had to be produced and an oath to tell the truth had to be taken, the former president failed to make his case.Just think about this: The former president and his supporters have never been able to explain how they accept as accurate the other election results that took place on November 3rd -- the elections for governor, United States Senate, the House of Representatives -- elections in which they closed the gap in the House.They challenge none of that. The President's name was first, then we went down the line -- governors, senators, House of Representatives. Somehow, those results were accurate on the same ballot, but the presidential race was flawed?And on the same ballot, the same day, cast by the same voters.The only difference: The former President didn't lose those races; he just lost the one that was his own.Finally, the third Big Lie being told by a former President and his supporters is that the mob who sought to impose their will through violence are the nation's true patriots.Is that what you thought when you looked at the mob ransacking the Capitol, destroying property, literally defecating in the hallways, rifling through desks of senators and representatives, hunting down members of congress? Patriots? Not in my view.To me, the true patriots were the more than 150 [million] Americans who peacefully expressed their vote at the ballot box, the election workers who protected the integrity of the vote, and the heroes who defended this Capitol.You can't love your country only when you win.You can't obey the law only when it's convenient.You can't be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies.Those who stormed this Capitol and those who instigated and incited and those who called on them to do so held a dagger at the throat of America -- at American democracy.They didn't come here out of patriotism or principle. They came here in rage -- not in service of America, but rather in service of one man.Those who incited the mob -- the real plotters -- who were desperate to deny the certification of the election and defy the will of the voters.But their plot was foiled. Congressmen -- Democrats and Republicans -- stayed. Senators, representatives, staff -- they finished their work the Constitution demanded. They honored their oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.Look, folks, now it's up to all of us -- to 'We the People' -- to stand for the rule of law, to preserve the flame of democracy, to keep the promise of America alive.That promise is at risk, targeted by the forces that value brute strength over the sanctity of democracy, fear over hope, personal gain over public good.Make no mistake about it: We're living at an inflection point in history.Both at home and abroad, we're engaged anew in a struggle between democracy and autocracy, between the aspirations of the many and the greed of the few, between the people's right of self-determination and self- -- the self-seeking autocrat.From China to Russia and beyond, they're betting that democracy's days are numbered. They've actually told me democracy is too slow, too bogged down by division to succeed in today's rapidly changing, complicated world.And they're betting -- they're betting America will become more like them and less like us. They're betting that America is a place for the autocrat, the dictator, the strongman.I do not believe that. That is not who we are. That is not who we have ever been. And that is not who we should ever, ever be.Our Founding Fathers, as imperfect as they were, set in motion an experiment that changed the world -- literally changed the world.Here in America, the people would rule, power would be transferred peacefully -- never at the tip of a spear or the barrel of a gun.And they committed to paper an idea that couldn't live up to -- they couldn't live up to but an idea that couldn't be constrained: Yes, in America all people are created equal.We reject the view that if you succeed, I fail; if you get ahead, I fall behind; if I hold you down, I somehow lift myself up.The former President, who lies about this election, and the mob that attacked this Capitol could not be further away from the core American values.They want to rule or they will ruin -- ruin what our country fought for at Lexington and Concord; at Gettysburg; at Omaha Beach; Seneca Falls; Selma, Alabama. What -- and what we were fighting for: the right to vote, the right to govern ourselves, the right to determine our own destiny.And with rights come responsibilities: the responsibility to see each other as neighbors -- maybe we disagree with that neighbor, but they're not an adversary; the responsibility to accept defeat then get back in the arena and try again the next time to make your case; the responsibility to see that America is an idea -- an idea that requires vigilant stewardship.As we stand here today -- one year since January 6th, 2021 -- the lies that drove the anger and madness we saw in this place, they have not abated.So, we have to be firm, resolute, and unyielding in our defense of the right to vote and to have that vote counted.Some have already made the ultimate sacrifice in this sacred effort.Jill and I have mourned police officers in this Capitol Rotunda not once but twice in the wake of January 6th: once to honor Officer Brian Sicknick, who lost his life the day after the attack, and a second time to honor Officer Billy Evans, who lost his life defending this Capitol as well.We think about the others who lost their lives and were injured and everyone living with the trauma of that day -- from those defending this Capitol to members of Congress in both parties and their staffs, to reporters, cafeteria workers, custodial workers, and their families.Don't kid yourself: The pain and scars from that day run deep.I said it many times and it's no more true or real than when we think about the events of January 6th: We are in a battle for the soul of America. A battle that, by the grace of God and the goodness and gracious -- and greatness of this nation, we will win.Believe me, I know how difficult democracy is. And I'm crystal clear about the threats America faces. But I also know that our darkest days can lead to light and hope.From the death and destruction, as the Vice President referenced, in Pearl Harbor came the triumph over the forces of fascism.From the brutality of Bloody Sunday on the Edmund Pettus Bridge came historic voting rights legislation.So, now let us step up, write the next chapter in American history where January 6th marks not the end of democracy, but the beginning of a renaissance of liberty and fair play.I did not seek this fight brought to this Capitol one year ago today, but I will not shrink from it either.I will stand in this breach. I will defend this nation. And I will allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy.We will make sure the will of the people is heard; that the ballot prevails, not violence; that authority in this nation will always be peacefully transferred.I believe the power of the presidency and the purpose is to unite this nation, not divide it; to lift us up, not tear us apart; to be about us -- about us, not about 'me.'Deep in the heart of America burns a flame lit almost 250 years ago -- of liberty, freedom, and equality.This is not a land of kings or dictators or autocrats. We're a nation of laws; of order, not chaos; of peace, not violence.Here in America, the people rule through the ballot, and their will prevails.So, let us remember: Together, we're one nation, under God, indivisible; that today, tomorrow, and forever, at our best, we are the United States of America.God bless you all. May God protect our troops. And may God bless those who stand watch over our democracy.  ",0.109
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10375777/Chuck-Schumer-says-Capitol-mob-shouted-theres-big-Jew-lets-him.html,"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democratic senators recounted their experiences on January 6 during floor speeches Thursday before the Senate held a moment of silence to observe the one-year anniversary of the Capitol attack. Schumer recalled being 'within 30 feet of these nasty, racist, bigoted insurrectionists,' recalling footage that had been shared during former President Donald Trump's second impeachment of the New York Democrat's narrow escape. 'I was told later that one of them reportedly said, 'There's the big Jew, let's get him,'' said Schumer. 'Bigotry against one, is bigotry against all,' he added. The antisemitic anecdote was originally told to The New York Times in March.   'And I saw something that I've been told later never happened before - the Confederate flag flying in this dear Capitol,' Schumer continued. 'That's just one of many, searing grotesque images of this unimaginable, most un-American day,' he said. Democratic senators lined up to make floor speeches to mark the one-year anniversary.Many of their Republican counterparts were out of town for the funeral of the late Sen. Johnny Isakson.  Earlier, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell sent out a statement calling January 6 a 'dark day for Congress and our country,' but lambasting Democrats for trying to get voting rights legislation passed by tying the bills to the anniversary of the deadly attack. A number of Democratic senators referenced the voting rights bills - which are stuck in the upper chamber due to its filibuster rules - when they spoke on the floor Thursday. Schumer has pushed changing the filibuster rules to get the bills through.  'Senators should not be trying to exploit this anniversary to damage the Senate in a different way from within,' McConnell said.  At noon, Sen. Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, was in the chair and announced the moment of silence. Across the Capitol, in the House chamber, lawmakers were holding their moment of silence as well.   When it was her turn to speak, Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat from Minnesota, called out her Republican colleagues by name. Smith noted that in the aftermath of the insurrection 'some Republicans spoke the truth about the terrible tragedy of that day.' 'Senator McConnell said, and I quote, ""The mob was fed lies. They were provoked by the president and other powerful people,""' Smith said. 'Sen. Lindsey Graham, sitting right over there, declared in reference to the disgraced former president, ""Count me out, enough is enough.""' After President Joe Biden delivered remarks Thursday morning, Graham went after his speech in a tweet, calling it 'brazen politicization of January 6.''So for a moment, it seemed like we would unify in condemning the political violence incited by a president who had betrayed our fundamental democratic principles,' Smith said. 'But later that night Sen. Cruz, Sen. Hawley and six other senators, voted to overturn our free and fair elections, continuing down this reckless path.' Smith called out the GOP for continuing to push Trump's so-called 'big lie.' 'They claim that the people who stormed the Capitol with zip-ties and bludgeons were tourists. They've attempted to portray the violent insurgents as martyrs rather than domestic terrorists,' she said. 'And this is why today, 58 per cent of Republicans believe falsely that the election was stolen from President Trump.'  During his time on the floor, Senate President Pro Tempore Patrick Leahy of Vermont – the longest serving sitting member of the chamber – spoke about visiting the Senate as a teenager and later as a law student before being sworn in in 1975. 'I never expected to become the dean of the Senate. A year ago I sat on the floor of the Senate as vice president Pence was announcing the certification of ballots,' he began.'We were all in the Senate paying attention when suddenly officers came rushing on the floor … Most of us – I remember looking around you we were wondering what was happening?Until I saw a few feet from me, I saw a man wearing a vest that said 'Police.' On the Senate floor he was carrying a submachine gun. I had never seen anything like this in the U.S. Senate.'Then Leahy described being rushed to the basement of the Capitol and a secure location amid the chaos of the riot.'I still tried to sort through my mind what was happening. Officers were going through the halls when one officer came along and took my arm and he said,' Leahy recounted, pausing to collect himself.'He said, ""We're going to watch out for you, Shamrock,""' he said. 'So many memories flooded back because Shamrock was a police codename for me when I was a recipient of a deadly Anthrax letter addressed to me that killed and mamed others,' Leahy recalled. ",0.034
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10375561/Trump-tears-Bidens-speech-political-theater-distraction.html,"Donald Trump slammed his successor after President Biden tore into him, repeatedly referring to him as the 'defeated former president.' 'Biden, who is destroying our Nation with insane policies of open Borders, corrupt Elections, disastrous energy policies, unconstitutional mandates, and devastating school closures, used my name today to try to further divide America,' Trump said in a series of statements. Trump then, without evidence, claimed that in Georgia voters sold ballots for $10 a piece. 'Where did all those votes show up from in Georgia, where it was just revealed they sold ballots for $10 a piece, or in Pennsylvania, and Arizona, and Wisconsin,' Trump said, claiming the 2020 election was rigged. 'He [Biden] acts like he's aggrieved, but we're the ones who were aggrieved,' Trump continued. Biden moments earlier had eviscerated Trump for watching TV while a mob stormed the Capitol on January 6, mocked his 'bruised ego.' He referred to the 'former president' 16 times but did not invoke Trump's name once.  'Biden is working hard to try and deflect the incompetent job he is doing, and has done, on the horrible Afghanistan withdrawal (surrender), the Borders, COVID, Inflation, loss of Energy Independence, and much more. Everything he touches turns to failure. That’s what you get when you have a rigged Election,' Trump said. The former president then went after the House select committee investigating Jan. 6, which has hit a number of his allies with subpoenas and requested records of his conversations and actions leading up to that day. 'Why is it that the Unselect Committee of totally partisan political hacks, whose judgment has long ago been made, not discussing the rigged Presidential Election of 2020? It’s because they don’t have the answers or justifications for what happened,' Trump said. 'They want all conversation concerning the Election “Canceled.” Just look at the numbers, they speak for themselves. They are not justifiable, so the complicit media just calls it the Big Lie, when in actuality the Big Lie was the Election itself.'Trump was originally scheduled to hold a press conference at Mar-a-Lago on Jan. 6, but abruptly canceled this week.  'It looks like he saw the speech, I guess that's good news. Maybe he learned something,' White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters about the former president's series of statements.  Biden, with Vice President Kamala Harris by his side, addressed the Capitol attack from Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol - one of the rooms hoards of Trump supporters traipsed through as they tried to break into the House chamber as lawmakers worked to certify Biden's election. 'We saw with our own eyes rioters menace these halls, threatening the life of the Speaker of the House. Literally erecting gallows to hang the vice president of the United States of America,' Biden recalled. 'What did we not see? We didn't see a former president, who just rallied the mob to attack, sitting in a private dining room off the Oval Office in the White House watching it all on television and doing nothing for hours.'    Biden went after the MAGA mob saying: 'This wasn't a group of tourists. This was an armed insurrection.'   'Here is the truth,' Biden continued. 'The former president of the United States of America created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election.' Trump did so 'because he values power over principle. Because he sees his own interest as more important than his country's interest, than America's interest,' Biden said. 'And because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution,' Biden stated. 'He can't accept he lost.' Trump accused Democrats of 'stoking fears' related to the attack. 'The Democrats want to own this day of January 6th so they can stoke fears and divide America. I say, let them have it because America sees through theirs [sic] lies and polarizations.' In a follow-up statement, Trump said that Biden's speech was 'very hurtful.' 'To watch Biden speaking is very hurtful to many people. They're the ones who tried to stop the peaceful transfer with a rigged election. Just look at the numbers. Does anybody really think that Biden beat Obama with the Black population in select Swing State cities, but nowhere else?' FIRST STATEMENT - 10:00AM: Biden, who is destroying our Nation with insane policies of open Borders, corrupt Elections, disastrous energy policies, unconstitutional mandates, and devastating school closures, used my name today to try to further divide America. This political theater is all just a distraction for the fact Biden has completely and totally failed. Our Country no longer has Borders, has totally and completely lost control of Covid (record numbers!), is no longer Energy Independent, Inflation is rampant, our Military is in chaos, and our exit, or surrender, from Afghanistan was perhaps the most embarrassing day in the long and distinguished history of the United States—and so much more. Why is it that the Unselect Committee of totally partisan political hacks, whose judgment has long ago been made, not discussing the rigged Presidential Election of 2020? It's because they don't have the answers or justifications for what happened. They got away with something, and it is leading to our Country's destruction. They want all conversation concerning the Election 'Canceled.' Just look at the numbers, they speak for themselves. They are not justifiable, so the complicit media just calls it the Big Lie, when in actuality the Big Lie was the Election itself.The Democrats want to own this day of January 6th so they can stoke fears and divide America. I say, let them have it because America sees through theirs lies and polarizations.SECOND STATEMENT- 10.12AM: Biden is working hard to try and deflect the incompetent job he is doing, and has done, on the horrible Afghanistan withdrawal (surrender), the Borders, COVID, Inflation, loss of Energy Independence, and much more. Everything he touches turns to failure. That's what you get when you have a rigged Election. THIRD STATEMENT -  12.39PM: To watch Biden speaking is very hurtful to many people. They're the ones who tried to stop the peaceful transfer with a rigged election. Just look at the numbers. Does anybody really think that Biden beat Obama with the Black population in select Swing State cities, but nowhere else? That he would lose 18 out of 19 bellwether counties, and 27 out of 27 'toss up' House races, but somehow miraculously receive the most votes in American history with no coattails? That he would lose Florida, Ohio, and Iowa and win, even though it has never been done before? They spread a 'web of lies' about me and Russia for 4 years to try to overturn the 2016 election, and now they lie about how they interfered in the 2020 Election, too. Big Tech was used illegally. Where did all those votes show up from in Georgia, where it was just revealed they sold ballots for $10 a piece, or in Pennsylvania, and Arizona, and Wisconsin. He acts like he's aggrieved, but we're the ones who were aggrieved and America is suffering because of it with poisonous Borders, record Inflation, a humiliating surrender in Afghanistan, $5 a gallon gas and higher, empty stock shelves, and rampant crime. America is a laughingstock stock of the world, and it's all because of the real insurrection, which took place on November 3rd, but this is an election year and MAGA Republicans should get elected and work with me to fix this horror that Joe Biden and the Democrats have brought us.Never forget the crime of the 2020 Presidential Election. Never give up!Biden spoke at length about the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election - as Trump has continued to spout the so-called 'big lie,' that he lost out on a second term due to widespread election fraud.  'The big lie being told by the former president and many Republicans who fear his wrath is that the insurrection in this country actually took place on election day November 3, 2020,' Biden noted. The president said that Trump and his supporters are trying to 're-write history.' 'That the riot that took place on January 6 is a true expression of the will of the people. Can you think of a more twisted way to look at this country, to look at America?' Biden asked. 'I cannot.'   'Over 150 million Americans went to the polls and voted that day. In a pandemic. Some at great risk to their lives. They should be applauded not attacked,' the president added. He briefly mentioned Democrats' voting rights push, pointing out how 'new laws are being written not to protect the vote, but to deny it.' Biden will travel to Georgia on Tuesday to give a broader voting rights address. 'The former president and his supporters, the only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert our elections,' Biden said. 'It's wrong. It's undemocratic, and frankly, it is un-American.' The 'second big lie,' Biden continued, was Trump telling his supporters the results of the 2020 election can't be trusted. 'The truth is that no election, no election in American history, has been more closely scrutinized or more carefully counted,' the president pointed out.   'He was just looking for an excuse, a pretext to cover for the truth,' Biden said. 'He is not just a former president, he is a defeated former president.' 'Defeated by a margin of over 7 million of your votes. In a full and free and fair election,' Biden continued. 'There is simply zero proof the election results were inaccurate.'   A 'third big lie,' Biden said, came when Trump and his supporters called the MAGA mob who stormed the Capitol 'the nation's true patriots.' 'Is that what you thought when you looked at the mob ransacking the capitol, destroying property, literally defecating in the hallways?' the president said. 'Going through the desks of senators and representative. Hunting down members of Congress.' 'Patriots?' Biden asked. 'Not in my view.' Biden said the true patriots were the country's voters, the elecion workers and law enforcement who defended the Capitol on January 6. 'You can't love your country only when you win,' he said. 'You can't obey the law only when it is convenient. You can't be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies.' Biden never used Trump's name during the Thursday morning address, instead referring to him as 'the former president.' 'I didn't want to make it a contemporary political battle,' Biden told reporters as he departed the Capitol.  In a statement after Biden's speech, Trump again called the election 'rigged' and repeated 'the Big Lie was the Election itself.' 'This political theater is all just a distraction for the fact Biden has completely and totally failed,' Trump added, pointing to inflation, Afghanistan, the migrant crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border and the continued coronavirus pandemic, including school closures. Vice President Kamala Harris compared the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol one year ago to the bombing of Pearl Harbor and 9/11. 'Certain dates echo throughout history, including dates that instantly remind all who have lived through them where they were and what they were doing, when our democracy came under assault,' Harris began. 'December 7, 1941, September 11, 2001 and January 6, 2021.'Harris alluded to civil rights fights of the past century. 'What the extremists who roamed these halls targeted was not only the lives of elected leaders ... what they were assaulting were the institutions, the values, the ideals that generations of Americans have marched, picketed and shed blood to establish and defend.'  'We cannot let our future be decided by those bent on silencing our voices, overturning our votes, and peddling lies and misinformation by some radical faction that may be newly resurgent, but whose roots run old and deep.' Harris then called the U.S. the 'oldest and greatest democracy in the world.' 'I wonder, how will January 6 be come to be remembered?' Harris said. 'Will it be remembered as a moment that accelerated the unraveling of the oldest and greatest democracy in the world? Or a moment when we decided to secure and strengthen our democracy for generations to come?'Democracy was coined by the Greeks in 430 B.C., means 'for the people' and many communities such as Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the UK's Isle of Man, San Marino and Switzerland have had so-called democracies dating back to the ninth and tenth centuries. The Capitol building was quiet Thursday morning as Democrats prepared to spend the day in remembrance. There was a heavy police presence and several metal interlocking barricades surrounding the building. Snow was on the ground from the storm earlier in the week. Upon arriving at the Capitol, the president told reporters, 'I'm praying that we never have another day like we had a year ago today. That's what I'm praying.' He was escorted into the building by Democratic leaders, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Republicans have accused Democrats of playing politics with the anniversary.Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell called January 6 a 'dark day' in a statement but then pivoted to attacking Democrats for trying to change Senate rules in order to pass voting rights legislation.'It has been stunning to see some Washington Democrats try to exploit this anniversary to advance partisan policy goals that long predated this event,' McConnell said. 'It is especially jaw-dropping to hear some Senate Democrats invoke the mob's attempt to disrupt our country's norms, rules, and institutions as a justification to discard our norms, rules, and institutions themselves.' Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close friend to Trump, reacted to Biden's speech by saying, 'What brazen politicization of January 6 by President Biden.' 'I wonder if the Taliban who now rule Afghanistan with al-Qaeda elements present, contrary to President Biden's beliefs, are allowing this speech to be carried?' Graham added. The Biden administration has been reluctant to directly discuss Trump particularly given that the former president continues the false claim that he won the 2020 presidential election.Psaki also went after members of the Republican Party who have supported Trump's lie that he was the presidential victor. 'What you'll hear the president talking about tomorrow is the fact that you don't just love your country when you win,' she told Dailymail.com. 'You love your country, you love democracy in any in any scenario, and what is most disappointing to him is that there has been a silence and, at times, a complacency by far too many Republicans who have sat by and defended the big lie and perpetuated misinformation to the American public.'Psaki did not mince words in her press briefing about the administration's view of Trump. The former president addressed his supporters outside the White House on January 6, 2021 before they marched on the Capitol and tried to stop the certification of Biden's victory. House Democrats impeached Trump for his role but he was acquitted by the Senate. Biden has been 'clear eyed about the threat the former president represents to our democracy and how the former president constantly works to constantly undermine basic American values and rule of law,' Psaki said.She noted that Biden sees January 6th as a 'tragic culmination of what those four years under President Trump did to our country.'Trump canceled a planned press conference for January 6th. Democrats, meanwhile, are ramping up their probe of the January 6th insurrection ahead of Thursday's one-year anniversary, considering 'Watergate-style' prime-time hearings with a bold-faced witness wish list that includes Mike Pence and Sean Hannity.Speaker Nancy Pelosi has a day-long slate of events planned for the one-year anniversary of the MAGA riot on Thursday, including a moment of silence on the House floor, testimony from lawmakers about their experience that day, and a prayer vigil on the steps of the Capitol.  'These events are intended as an observance of reflection, remembrance and recommitment, in a spirit of unity, patriotism and prayerfulness,' Pelosi wrote in a letter to lawmakers.  Republicans, who have not revealed their plans for how they will mark the day, accused Democrats of grandstanding.'I think they will try to politicize the event,' Republican Senator John Thune said.In a bid capitalize on the anniversary, Democrats on committee are looking to crank up the pace of their probe and draw a massive audience with prime-time hearings. 9 am: President Biden and Vice President Harris deliver remarks in National Statuary Hall in the Capitol10 am: Speaker Nancy Pelosi hold a closed-press Moment of Reflection on the House floor12 pm: A statement from Speaker Pelosi and a Moment of Silence on the House Floor 1 pm: Dr. Carla Hayden, Librarian of Congress; Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin; and Historian Jon Meacham moderate a conversation with Speaker Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer2:30 pm: Democratic Rep. Jason Crow leads lawmakers in giving testimonials about what they experienced on January 6th5:30 pm: Pelosi and Schumer lead a Bicameral Prayer Vigil on Capitol Center Steps'I have favored this strategy from the beginning,' Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, a member of the panel, told MSNBC's Morning Joe on Wednesday. He said he wanted a Watergate-style approach, when the 1973 hearings into Richard Nixon's presidency captivated America. At one point an estimated 85% of the country was tuned in to them.'I remember as a kid getting to watch a bit of the Watergate hearings, which were a daily spectacle that the whole country tuned into,' Raskin said. 'If we can do that for, you know, a break-in in a couple of offices in the Watergate hotel, certainly, we can do it for a massive break-in into the Capitol of the United States, a storming, and a seizure essentially of our government offices, an interruption of the peaceful transfer of power.'Those prime-time hearings could occur in late March or early April, Rep. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, told Bloomberg News.But no date has been set yet. 'We're working toward that,' Thompson said. Those hearings would also feature high-profile witnesses, which would help them gain maximum exposure. Among those names beiing considered are former Vice President Mike Pence and Fox News host Sean Hannity.Pence was under heavy pressure from then-President Donald Trump to declare the 2020 election results invalid, wipe out Joe Biden's victory and secure him a second term. The vice president has the symbolic role of presiding over the Electoral College certification of results. Pence was a target of the January 6th rioters, some of who threatened to hang him, and was evacuated from the Senate floor as the MAGA supporters stormed the Capitol.Thompson told CNN that he and the panel would like to hear from Pence.'I would hope that he would do the right thing and come forward and voluntarily talk to the committee,' he said.'We have not formally asked. But if he offered, we'd gladly accept. Everything is under consideration,' he added. So far, in its investigation, the committee has interviewed more than 300 witnesses, announced more than 50 subpoenas, obtained more than 35,000 pages of records and received hundreds of telephone tips through their Jan. 6 tipline, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Names are starting to be lined up for hearings. The panel on Tuesday asked longtime Trump supporter Sean Hannity to appear as a 'fact witness' in their investigation, noting how the Fox star was 'expressing concerns and providing advice to the president and White House staff.' The committee released several texts Hannity sent to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.'I'm very worried about the next 48 hours,' Hannity wrote on the eve of January 6th.On January 5, the eve of the Capitol attack, Hannity also texted to Meadows, 'Pence pressure. WH counsel will leave.' In the letter to Hannity, Thompson wrote the texts suggest 'that you had knowledge of concerns by President Trump's White House Counsel's Office regarding the legality of the former President's plans for January 6th.' 'These facts are directly relevant to our inquiry,' Thompson told Hannity. Thompson also said that Hannity appeared to have 'detailed knowledge regarding President Trump's state of mind in the days following the January 6th attack.' One of Hannity's texts indicated he had a discussion with Trump on January 10 and it left the Fox News host concerned in the lead-up to President Joe Biden's January 20 inauguration. 'Guys, we have a clear path to land the plane in 9 days,' Hannity informed Meadows and Republican Rep. Jim Jordan. 'He can't mention the election again. Ever. I did not have a good call with him today. And worse, I'm not sure what is left to do or say, and I don't like not knowing if it's truly understood. Ideas?' On his Fox News show on Tuesday evening, Hannity launched into a stinging rebuke of DC officials and their 'willing accomplices' but didn't mention the letter from the House committee investigating the MAGA riot.'I have an important message to all you elected swamp creatures in Washington, D.C., your willing accomplices, your press secretaries in the media mob,' he began. 'It is frankly repulsive, just repulsive that all of you sycophants, you sit idly by, you say nothing, you do nothing, as Joe Biden completely mismanages COVID-19,' he said.Republicans have not revealed their plans for how they will mark the one-year anniversary of the riot.Many Republican lawmakers criticized Trump in the immediate wake of January 6th - some even called him that day to encourage him to try and call off the rioters. But, many of them also have made amends with the former president in the months following particularly as Trump continues to hold a tight grip on Republican base.  Many Republican senators, including Leader Mitch McConnell, will be in Atlanta for the funeral of former Senator Johnny Isakson on Thursday. Earlier this week, members of the House panel indicated they had received testimony from inside Trump's West Wing from January 6th that focuses on Trump's failure to do more to stop the rioters. Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the panel, revealed there was 'firsthand' testimony that Ivanka Trump twice asked her father to call off the rioters. 'We know members of his family, we know his daughter - we have firsthand testimony that his daughter Ivanka went in at least twice to ask him to please stop this violence,' Cheney said Sunday on ABC's This Week.Ivanka reportedly referred to the insurrection as an 'optics issue' as it was taking place, according to Michael Wolff's latest Trump book Landslide.  She tried to stop the riot herself, tweeting: 'American Patriots - any security breach or disrespect to our law enforcement is unacceptable. The violence must stop immediately. Please be peaceful.' The tweet has since been deleted. Meanwhile, the House committee has been rebuffed by several former Trump aides or advisers whose testimony was sought by subpoena.That includes former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and Meadows. Bannon has been indicted for criminal contempt of Congress for refusing to testify to the panel and awaits trial in July. The House in December voted to hold Meadows in contempt, referring the case to the Justice Department. Madam Vice President, my fellow Americans: To state the obvious, one year ago today, in this sacred place, democracy was attacked -- simply attacked. The will of the people was under assault. The Constitution -- our Constitution -- faced the gravest of threats.Outnumbered and in the face of a brutal attack, the Capitol Police, the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, the National Guard, and other brave law enforcement officials saved the rule of law.Our democracy held. We the people endured. And we the people prevailed.For the first time in our history, a president had not just lost an election, he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob breached the Capitol.But they failed. They failed.And on this day of remembrance, we must make sure that such an attack never, never happens again.I'm speaking to you today from Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol. This is where the House of Representativesmet for 50 years in the decades leading up to the Civil War. This is -- on this floor is where a young congressman of Illinois, Abraham Lincoln, sat at desk 191.Above him -- above us, over that door leading into the Rotunda -- is a sculpture depicting Clio, the muse of history. In her hands, an open book in which she records the events taking place in this chamber below.Clio stood watch over this hall one year ago today, as she has for more than 200 years. She recorded what took place. The real history. The real facts. The real truth. The factsand the truth that Vice President Harris just shared and that you and I and the whole world saw with our own eyes.The Bible tells us that we shall know the truth, and the truth shall make us free. We shall know the truth.Well, here is the God's truth about January 6th, 2021:Close your eyes. Go back to that day. What do you see? Rioters rampaging, waving for the first time inside this Capitol a Confederate flag that symbolized the cause to destroy America, to rip us apart.Even during the Civil War, that never, ever happened. But it happened here in 2021.What else do you see? A mob breaking windows, kicking in doors, breaching the Capitol. American flags on poles being used as weapons, as spears. Fire extinguishers being thrown at the heads of police officers.A crowd that professes their love for law enforcement assaulted those police officers, dragged them, sprayed them, stomped on them.Over 140 police officers were injured.We've all heard the police officers who were there that day testify to what happened. One officer called it, quote, a med- -- 'medieval' battle, and that he was more afraid that day than he was fighting the war in Iraq.They've repeatedly asked since that day: How dare anyone -- anyone -- diminish, belittle, or deny the hell they were put through?We saw it with our own eyes. Rioters menaced these halls, threatening the life of the Speaker of the House, literally erecting gallows to hang the Vice President of the United States of America.But what did we not see?We didn't see a former president, who had just rallied the mob to attack -- sitting in the private dining room off the Oval Office in the White House, watching it all on television and doing nothing for hours as police were assaulted, lives at risk, and the nation's capital under siege.This wasn't a group of tourists. This was an armed insurrection.They weren't looking to uphold the will of the people. They were looking to deny the will of the people.They were looking to uphold -- they weren't looking to uphold a free and fair election. They were looking to overturn one.They weren't looking to save the cause of America. They were looking to subvert the Constitution.This isn't about being bogged down in the past. This is about making sure the past isn't buried.That's the only way forward. That's what great nations do. They don't bury the truth, they face up to it. Sounds like hyperbole, but that's the truth: They face up to it.We are a great nation.My fellow Americans, in life, there's truth and,tragically, there are lies -- lies conceived and spread for profit and power.We must be absolutely clear about what is true and what is a lie.And here is the truth: The former president of theUnited States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election. He's done so because he values power over principle, because he sees his own interests as more important than his country's interests and America's interests, and because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution.He can't accept he lost, even though that's what 93 United States senators, his own Attorney General, his own Vice President, governors and state officials in every battleground state have all said: He lost.That's what 81 million of you did as you voted for a new way forward.He has done what no president in American history -- the history of this country -- has ever, ever done: He refused to accept the results of an election and the will of the American people.While some courageous men and women in the Republican Party are standing against it, trying to uphold the principles of that party, too many others are transforming that party into something else. They seem no longer to want to be the party -- the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Reagan, the Bushes.But whatever my other disagreements are with Republicans who support the rule of law and not the rule of a single man, I will always seek to work together with them to find shared solutions where possible. Because if we have a shared belief in democracy, then anything is possible -- anything.And so, at this moment, we must decide: What kind of nation are we going to be?Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm?Are we going to be a nation where we allow partisan election officials to overturn the legally expressed will of the people?Are we going to be a nation that lives not by the light of the truth but in the shadow of lies?We cannot allow ourselves to be that kind of nation. The way forward is to recognize the truth and to live by it.The Big Lie being told by the former president and many Republicans who fear his wrath is that the insurrection in this country actually took place on Election Day -- November 3rd, 2020.Think about that. Is that what you thought? Is that what you thought when you voted that day? Taking part in an insurrection? Is that what you thought you were doing? Or did you think you were carrying out your highest duty as a citizen and voting?The former president and his supporters are trying to rewrite history. They want you to see Election Day as the day of insurrection and the riot that took place here on January 6th as the true expression of the will of the people.Can you think of a more twisted way to look at this country -- to look at America? I cannot.Here's the truth: The election of 2020 was the greatest demonstration of democracy in the history of this country.More of you voted in that election than have ever voted in all of American history. Over 150 million Americans went to the polls and voted that day in a pandemic -- some at grea- -- great risk to their lives. They should be applauded, not attacked.Right now, in state after state, new laws are being written -- not to protect the vote, but to deny it; not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert it; not to strengthen or protect our democracy, but because the former president lost.Instead of looking at the election results from 2020 and saying they need new ideas or better ideas to win more votes, the former president and his supporters have decided the only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert our elections.It's wrong. It's undemocratic. And frankly, it's un-American.The second Big Lie being told by the former President and his supporters is that the results of the election of 2020 can't be trusted.The truth is that no election -- no election in American history has been more closely scrutinized or more carefully counted.Every legal challenge questioning the results in every court in this country that could have been made was made and was rejected -- often rejected by Republican-appointed judges, including judges appointed by the former president himself, from state courts to the United States Supreme Court.Recounts were undertaken in state after state. Georgia -- Georgia counted its results three times, with one recount by hand.Phony partisan audits were undertaken long after the election in several states. None changed the results. And in some of them, the irony is the margin of victory actually grew slightly.So, let's speak plainly about what happened in 2020. Even before the first ballot was cast, the former presidentwas preemptively sowing doubt about the election results. He built his lie over months. It wasn't based on any facts. He was just looking for an excuse -- a pretext -- to cover for the truth.He's not just a former president. He's a defeated former president -- defeated by a margin of over 7 million of your votes in a full and free and fair election.There is simply zero proof the election results were inaccurate. In fact, in every venue where evidence had to be produced and an oath to tell the truth had to be taken, the former president failed to make his case.Just think about this: The former president and his supporters have never been able to explain how they accept as accurate the other election results that took place on November 3rd -- the elections for governor, United States Senate, the House of Representatives -- elections in which they closed the gap in the House.They challenge none of that. The President's name was first, then we went down the line -- governors, senators, House of Representatives. Somehow, those results were accurate on the same ballot, but the presidential race was flawed?And on the same ballot, the same day, cast by the same voters.The only difference: The former President didn't lose those races; he just lost the one that was his own.Finally, the third Big Lie being told by a former President and his supporters is that the mob who sought to impose their will through violence are the nation's true patriots.Is that what you thought when you looked at the mob ransacking the Capitol, destroying property, literally defecating in the hallways, rifling through desks of senators and representatives, hunting down members of congress? Patriots? Not in my view.To me, the true patriots were the more than 150 [million] Americans who peacefully expressed their vote at the ballot box, the election workers who protected the integrity of the vote, and the heroes who defended this Capitol.You can't love your country only when you win.You can't obey the law only when it's convenient.You can't be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies.Those who stormed this Capitol and those who instigated and incited and those who called on them to do so held a dagger at the throat of America -- at American democracy.They didn't come here out of patriotism or principle. They came here in rage -- not in service of America, but rather in service of one man.Those who incited the mob -- the real plotters -- who were desperate to deny the certification of the election and defy the will of the voters.But their plot was foiled. Congressmen -- Democrats and Republicans -- stayed. Senators, representatives, staff -- they finished their work the Constitution demanded. They honored their oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.Look, folks, now it's up to all of us -- to 'We the People' -- to stand for the rule of law, to preserve the flame of democracy, to keep the promise of America alive.That promise is at risk, targeted by the forces that value brute strength over the sanctity of democracy, fear over hope, personal gain over public good.Make no mistake about it: We're living at an inflection point in history.Both at home and abroad, we're engaged anew in a struggle between democracy and autocracy, between the aspirations of the many and the greed of the few, between the people's right of self-determination and self- -- the self-seeking autocrat.From China to Russia and beyond, they're betting that democracy's days are numbered. They've actually told me democracy is too slow, too bogged down by division to succeed in today's rapidly changing, complicated world.And they're betting -- they're betting America will become more like them and less like us. They're betting that America is a place for the autocrat, the dictator, the strongman.I do not believe that. That is not who we are. That is not who we have ever been. And that is not who we should ever, ever be.Our Founding Fathers, as imperfect as they were, set in motion an experiment that changed the world -- literally changed the world.Here in America, the people would rule, power would be transferred peacefully -- never at the tip of a spear or the barrel of a gun.And they committed to paper an idea that couldn't live up to -- they couldn't live up to but an idea that couldn't be constrained: Yes, in America all people are created equal.We reject the view that if you succeed, I fail; if you get ahead, I fall behind; if I hold you down, I somehow lift myself up.The former President, who lies about this election, and the mob that attacked this Capitol could not be further away from the core American values.They want to rule or they will ruin -- ruin what our country fought for at Lexington and Concord; at Gettysburg; at Omaha Beach; Seneca Falls; Selma, Alabama. What -- and what we were fighting for: the right to vote, the right to govern ourselves, the right to determine our own destiny.And with rights come responsibilities: the responsibility to see each other as neighbors -- maybe we disagree with that neighbor, but they're not an adversary; the responsibility to accept defeat then get back in the arena and try again the next time to make your case; the responsibility to see that America is an idea -- an idea that requires vigilant stewardship.As we stand here today -- one year since January 6th, 2021 -- the lies that drove the anger and madness we saw in this place, they have not abated.So, we have to be firm, resolute, and unyielding in our defense of the right to vote and to have that vote counted.Some have already made the ultimate sacrifice in this sacred effort.Jill and I have mourned police officers in this Capitol Rotunda not once but twice in the wake of January 6th: once to honor Officer Brian Sicknick, who lost his life the day after the attack, and a second time to honor Officer Billy Evans, who lost his life defending this Capitol as well.We think about the others who lost their lives and were injured and everyone living with the trauma of that day -- from those defending this Capitol to members of Congress in both parties and their staffs, to reporters, cafeteria workers, custodial workers, and their families.Don't kid yourself: The pain and scars from that day run deep.I said it many times and it's no more true or real than when we think about the events of January 6th: We are in a battle for the soul of America. A battle that, by the grace of God and the goodness and gracious -- and greatness of this nation, we will win.Believe me, I know how difficult democracy is. And I'm crystal clear about the threats America faces. But I also know that our darkest days can lead to light and hope.From the death and destruction, as the Vice President referenced, in Pearl Harbor came the triumph over the forces of fascism.From the brutality of Bloody Sunday on the Edmund Pettus Bridge came historic voting rights legislation.So, now let us step up, write the next chapter in American history where January 6th marks not the end of democracy, but the beginning of a renaissance of liberty and fair play.I did not seek this fight brought to this Capitol one year ago today, but I will not shrink from it either.I will stand in this breach. I will defend this nation. And I will allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy.We will make sure the will of the people is heard; that the ballot prevails, not violence; that authority in this nation will always be peacefully transferred.I believe the power of the presidency and the purpose is to unite this nation, not divide it; to lift us up, not tear us apart; to be about us -- about us, not about 'me.'Deep in the heart of America burns a flame lit almost 250 years ago -- of liberty, freedom, and equality.This is not a land of kings or dictators or autocrats. We're a nation of laws; of order, not chaos; of peace, not violence.Here in America, the people rule through the ballot, and their will prevails.So, let us remember: Together, we're one nation, under God, indivisible; that today, tomorrow, and forever, at our best, we are the United States of America.God bless you all. May God protect our troops. And may God bless those who stand watch over our democracy.  ",0.103
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10375211/Biden-heads-Capitol-January-6-speech-blame-Trump-chaos-carnage.html,"President Joe Biden tore into former President Donald Trump for watching TV while a mob stormed the Capitol on January 6, mocked his 'bruised ego' and accused him and his supporters of holding a 'dagger in the throat of democracy' in a speech on Thursday.In his most searing attack on his predecessor to date, Biden called Trump a 'defeated former president' and criticized him for 'refusing to accept he lost' the November 2020 in remarks on the one-year anniversary of the attack alongside Kamala Harris.'We saw with our own eyes rioters menace these halls, threatening the life of the Speaker of the House. Literally erecting gallows to hang the vice president of the United States of America,' Biden recalled. 'What did we not see? We didn't see a former president, who just rallied the mob to attack, sitting in a private dining room off the Oval Office in the White House watching it all on television and doing nothing for hours.'    Biden went after the MAGA mob saying: 'This wasn't a group of tourists. This was an armed insurrection.' He did not mention his predecessor by name but - 16 times - referred to him as 'the former president,' accusing Trump of creating and spreading 'a web of lies about the 2020 election.'Before Biden spoke, Kamala Harris compared January 6 to 9/11 and the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, wrongly called America the 'oldest democracy in the world' and slammed the 'extremists' who stormed the Capitol.Trump called Biden's speech 'political theater' and a distraction for his failures in a statement shortly after Biden finished, and doubled down on his false claim he won the 2020 election and the result was rigged.Biden's speech was filled with descriptive phrases: Trump's 'bruised ego' and 'web of lies.' He decried the rioters for 'ransacking the capitol, destroying property, literally defecating in the hallways?'After his remarks, Biden told reporters in the Capitol that he was concerned about a new attitude in politics of it's all about it me.'That's the thing that bothers me most about the sort of attitude that seems to be emerging to some degree in American politics. It's not about you, it's about me. That's how it's viewed. But it's not about me,' he said. And he told DailyMail.com he didn't mention Trump by name because he didn't want to start a 'contemporary political battle.''I did not want to turn it into a contemporary political battle between me and the president. It's way beyond that. It's way beyond that,' he said.But Biden made his remarks at the start of 2022, the year of a midterm election where Republicans are looking to retake control of Congress and Trump is playing a kingmaker role in that party. Republicans have already attacked Biden and the Democrats for turning the one-year anniversary of the January 6th riot into a political event and accused them of trying to use the occasion to jam through legislation on voting rights.  GOP Senator Lindsey Graham accused Biden of 'brazen politicization' and called the speech an 'effort to resurrect a failed presidency.SCROLL DOWN FOR FULL SPEECH Biden mocks Trump's 'bruised ego' and the fact he 'can't accept he lost'In his remarks, Biden essentially called the former president a 'loser,' which will likely infuriate Trump. 'Because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution,' Biden stated. 'He can't accept he lost.' Vice President Kamala Harris compared the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol one year ago to the bombing of Pearl Harbor and 9/11. 'Certain dates echo throughout history, including dates that instantly remind all who have lived through them where they were and what they were doing, when our democracy came under assault,' Harris began. 'December 7, 1941, September 11, 2001 and January 6, 2021.'Harris alluded to civil rights fights of the past century. 'What the extremists who roamed these halls targeted was not only the lives of elected leaders ... what they were assaulting were the institutions, the values, the ideals that generations of Americans have marched, picketed and shed blood to establish and defend.'  'We cannot let our future be decided by those bent on silencing our voices, overturning our votes, and peddling lies and misinformation by some radical faction that may be newly resurgent, but whose roots run old and deep.' Harris then called the U.S. the 'oldest and greatest democracy in the world.' 'I wonder, how will January 6 be come to be remembered?' Harris said. 'Will it be remembered as a moment that accelerated the unraveling of the oldest and greatest democracy in the world? Or a moment when we decided to secure and strengthen our democracy for generations to come?'Democracy was coined by the Greeks in 430 B.C., means 'for the people' and many communities such as Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the UK's Isle of Man, San Marino and Switzerland have had so-called democracies dating back to the ninth and tenth centuries. He also charged that Trump continues the lie he won the election 'because he values power over principle. Because he sees his own interest as more important than his country's interest, than America's interest,' Biden said.  Trump said in his response: 'Biden is working hard to try and deflect the incompetent job he is doing, and has done, on the horrible Afghanistan withdrawal (surrender), the Borders, COVID, Inflation, loss of Energy Independence, and much more. Everything he touches turns to failure. That's what you get when you have a rigged Election.' In his speech, delivered in a nearly empty room, Biden spoke at length about the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election, offering his most detailed defense to date of his victory, which comes as Trump has continued to spout the so-called 'big lie,' that he lost out on a second term due to widespread election fraud. 'The big lie being told by the former president and many Republicans who fear his wrath is that the insurrection in this country actually took place on election day November 3, 2020,' Biden noted. The president said that Trump and his supporters are trying to 're-write history.' 'That the riot that took place on January 6 is a true expression of the will of the people. Can you think of a more twisted way to look at this country, to look at America?' Biden asked. 'I cannot.'   'Over 150 million Americans went to the polls and voted that day. In a pandemic. Some at great risk to their lives. They should be applauded not attacked,' the president added. He briefly mentioned Democrats' voting rights push, pointing out how 'new laws are being written not to protect the vote, but to deny it.' Biden will travel to Georgia on Tuesday to give a broader voting rights address. 'The former president and his supporters, the only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert our elections,' Biden said. 'It's wrong. It's undemocratic, and frankly, it is un-American.' The 'second big lie,' Biden continued, was Trump telling his supporters the results of the 2020 election can't be trusted. 'The truth is that no election, no election in American history, has been more closely scrutinized or more carefully counted,' the president pointed out.   'He was just looking for an excuse, a pretext to cover for the truth,' Biden said. 'He is not just a former president, he is a defeated former president.' 'Defeated by a margin of over 7 million of your votes. In a full and free and fair election,' Biden continued. 'There is simply zero proof the election results were inaccurate.'   A 'third big lie,' Biden said, came when Trump and his supporters called the MAGA mob who stormed the Capitol 'the nation's true patriots.' 'Is that what you thought when you looked at the mob ransacking the capitol, destroying property, literally defecating in the hallways?' the president said. 'Going through the desks of senators and representative. Hunting down members of Congress.' 'Patriots?' Biden asked. 'Not in my view.' Biden said the true patriots were the country's voters, the election workers and law enforcement who defended the Capitol on January 6. 'You can't love your country only when you win,' he said. 'You can't obey the law only when it is convenient. You can't be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies.' Biden: I didn't mention Trump because I didn't want to make it a 'contemporary political battle' Biden never used Trump's name during the Thursday morning address, instead referring to him as 'the former president.' 'I didn't want to make it a contemporary political battle,' Biden told reporters after he concluded his speech.  In a statement after Biden's speech, Trump again called the election 'rigged' and repeated 'the Big Lie was the Election itself.' 'This political theater is all just a distraction for the fact Biden has completely and totally failed,' Trump added, pointing to inflation, Afghanistan, the migrant crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border and the continued coronavirus pandemic, including school closures. The Capitol building was quiet Thursday morning as Democrats prepared to spend the day in remembrance. There was a heavy police presence and several metal interlocking barricades surrounding the building. Snow was on the ground from the storm earlier in the week. FIRST STATEMENT - 10:00AM: Biden, who is destroying our Nation with insane policies of open Borders, corrupt Elections, disastrous energy policies, unconstitutional mandates, and devastating school closures, used my name today to try to further divide America. This political theater is all just a distraction for the fact Biden has completely and totally failed. Our Country no longer has Borders, has totally and completely lost control of Covid (record numbers!), is no longer Energy Independent, Inflation is rampant, our Military is in chaos, and our exit, or surrender, from Afghanistan was perhaps the most embarrassing day in the long and distinguished history of the United States—and so much more. Why is it that the Unselect Committee of totally partisan political hacks, whose judgment has long ago been made, not discussing the rigged Presidential Election of 2020? It's because they don't have the answers or justifications for what happened. They got away with something, and it is leading to our Country's destruction. They want all conversation concerning the Election 'Canceled.' Just look at the numbers, they speak for themselves. They are not justifiable, so the complicit media just calls it the Big Lie, when in actuality the Big Lie was the Election itself.The Democrats want to own this day of January 6th so they can stoke fears and divide America. I say, let them have it because America sees through theirs lies and polarizations.SECOND STATEMENT- 10.12AM: Biden is working hard to try and deflect the incompetent job he is doing, and has done, on the horrible Afghanistan withdrawal (surrender), the Borders, COVID, Inflation, loss of Energy Independence, and much more. Everything he touches turns to failure. That's what you get when you have a rigged Election. THIRD STATEMENT -  12.39AM: To watch Biden speaking is very hurtful to many people. They're the ones who tried to stop the peaceful transfer with a rigged election. Just look at the numbers. Does anybody really think that Biden beat Obama with the Black population in select Swing State cities, but nowhere else? That he would lose 18 out of 19 bellwether counties, and 27 out of 27 'toss up' House races, but somehow miraculously receive the most votes in American history with no coattails? That he would lose Florida, Ohio, and Iowa and win, even though it has never been done before? They spread a 'web of lies' about me and Russia for 4 years to try to overturn the 2016 election, and now they lie about how they interfered in the 2020 Election, too. Big Tech was used illegally. Where did all those votes show up from in Georgia, where it was just revealed they sold ballots for $10 a piece, or in Pennsylvania, and Arizona, and Wisconsin. He acts like he's aggrieved, but we're the ones who were aggrieved and America is suffering because of it with poisonous Borders, record Inflation, a humiliating surrender in Afghanistan, $5 a gallon gas and higher, empty stock shelves, and rampant crime. America is a laughingstock stock of the world, and it's all because of the real insurrection, which took place on November 3rd, but this is an election year and MAGA Republicans should get elected and work with me to fix this horror that Joe Biden and the Democrats have brought us.Never forget the crime of the 2020 Presidential Election. Never give up!Upon arriving at the Capitol, the president told reporters, 'I'm praying that we never have another day like we had a year ago today. That's what I'm praying.' He was escorted into the building by Democratic leaders, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Mitch McConnell: Democrats are using January 6 to 'advance partisan policy Republicans have accused Democrats of playing politics with the anniversary.Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell called January 6 a 'dark day' in a statement but then pivoted to attacking Democrats for trying to change Senate rules in order to pass voting rights legislation.'It has been stunning to see some Washington Democrats try to exploit this anniversary to advance partisan policy goals that long predated this event,' McConnell said. 'It is especially jaw-dropping to hear some Senate Democrats invoke the mob's attempt to disrupt our country's norms, rules, and institutions as a justification to discard our norms, rules, and institutions themselves.' Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close friend to Trump, reacted to Biden's speech by saying, 'What brazen politicization of January 6 by President Biden.' 'I wonder if the Taliban who now rule Afghanistan with al-Qaeda elements present, contrary to President Biden's beliefs, are allowing this speech to be carried?' Graham added. Trump was supposed to address reporters Thursday from his Mar-a-Lago resort, but called off the press conference Tuesday night. The Biden administration has been reluctant to directly discuss Trump particularly given that the former president continues the false claim that he won the 2020 presidential election.But White House press secretary  Psaki did not mince words in her press briefing Wednesday about the administration's view of Trump. The former president addressed his supporters outside the White House on January 6, 2021 before they marched on the Capitol and tried to stop the certification of Biden's victory. House Democrats impeached Trump for his role but he was acquitted by the Senate. Biden has been 'clear eyed about the threat the former president represents to our democracy and how the former president constantly works to constantly undermine basic American values and rule of law,' Psaki said. She noted that Biden sees January 6th as a 'tragic culmination of what those four years under President Trump did to our country.'    In a bid capitalize on the anniversary, Democrats on committee are looking to crank up the pace of their probe and draw a massive audience with prime-time hearings. 'I have favored this strategy from the beginning,' Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, a member of the panel, told MSNBC's Morning Joe on Wednesday. He said he wanted a Watergate-style approach, when the 1973 hearings into Richard Nixon's presidency captivated America. At one point an estimated 85% of the country was tuned in to them.'I remember as a kid getting to watch a bit of the Watergate hearings, which were a daily spectacle that the whole country tuned into,' Raskin said. 'If we can do that for, you know, a break-in in a couple of offices in the Watergate hotel, certainly, we can do it for a massive break-in into the Capitol of the United States, a storming, and a seizure essentially of our government offices, an interruption of the peaceful transfer of power.'Those prime-time hearings could occur in late March or early April, Rep. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, told Bloomberg News.But no date has been set yet. 'We're working toward that,' Thompson said. Those hearings would also feature high-profile witnesses, which would help them gain maximum exposure. Among those names being considered are former Vice President Mike Pence.Pence was under heavy pressure from Trump to declare the 2020 election results invalid, wipe out Joe Biden's victory and secure him a second term. The vice president has the symbolic role of presiding over the Electoral College certification of results. Pence was a target of the January 6th rioters, some of who threatened to hang him, and was evacuated from the Senate floor as the MAGA supporters stormed the Capitol.Thompson told CNN that he and the panel would like to hear from Pence.'I would hope that he would do the right thing and come forward and voluntarily talk to the committee,' he said.'We have not formally asked. But if he offered, we'd gladly accept. Everything is under consideration,' he added. So far, in its investigation, the committee has interviewed more than 300 witnesses, announced more than 50 subpoenas, obtained more than 35,000 pages of records and received hundreds of telephone tips through their Jan. 6 tipline, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Names are starting to be lined up for hearings.  Madam Vice President, my fellow Americans: To state the obvious, one year ago today, in this sacred place, democracy was attacked -- simply attacked. The will of the people was under assault. The Constitution -- our Constitution -- faced the gravest of threats.Outnumbered and in the face of a brutal attack, the Capitol Police, the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, the National Guard, and other brave law enforcement officials saved the rule of law.Our democracy held. We the people endured. And we the people prevailed.For the first time in our history, a president had not just lost an election, he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob breached the Capitol.But they failed. They failed.And on this day of remembrance, we must make sure that such an attack never, never happens again.I'm speaking to you today from Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol. This is where the House of Representativesmet for 50 years in the decades leading up to the Civil War. This is -- on this floor is where a young congressman of Illinois, Abraham Lincoln, sat at desk 191.Above him -- above us, over that door leading into the Rotunda -- is a sculpture depicting Clio, the muse of history. In her hands, an open book in which she records the events taking place in this chamber below.Clio stood watch over this hall one year ago today, as she has for more than 200 years. She recorded what took place. The real history. The real facts. The real truth. The factsand the truth that Vice President Harris just shared and that you and I and the whole world saw with our own eyes.The Bible tells us that we shall know the truth, and the truth shall make us free. We shall know the truth.Well, here is the God's truth about January 6th, 2021:Close your eyes. Go back to that day. What do you see? Rioters rampaging, waving for the first time inside this Capitol a Confederate flag that symbolized the cause to destroy America, to rip us apart.Even during the Civil War, that never, ever happened. But it happened here in 2021.What else do you see? A mob breaking windows, kicking in doors, breaching the Capitol. American flags on poles being used as weapons, as spears. Fire extinguishers being thrown at the heads of police officers.A crowd that professes their love for law enforcement assaulted those police officers, dragged them, sprayed them, stomped on them.Over 140 police officers were injured.We've all heard the police officers who were there that day testify to what happened. One officer called it, quote, a med- -- 'medieval' battle, and that he was more afraid that day than he was fighting the war in Iraq.They've repeatedly asked since that day: How dare anyone -- anyone -- diminish, belittle, or deny the hell they were put through?We saw it with our own eyes. Rioters menaced these halls, threatening the life of the Speaker of the House, literally erecting gallows to hang the Vice President of the United States of America.But what did we not see?We didn't see a former president, who had just rallied the mob to attack -- sitting in the private dining room off the Oval Office in the White House, watching it all on television and doing nothing for hours as police were assaulted, lives at risk, and the nation's capital under siege.This wasn't a group of tourists. This was an armed insurrection.They weren't looking to uphold the will of the people. They were looking to deny the will of the people.They were looking to uphold -- they weren't looking to uphold a free and fair election. They were looking to overturn one.They weren't looking to save the cause of America. They were looking to subvert the Constitution.This isn't about being bogged down in the past. This is about making sure the past isn't buried.That's the only way forward. That's what great nations do. They don't bury the truth, they face up to it. Sounds like hyperbole, but that's the truth: They face up to it.We are a great nation.My fellow Americans, in life, there's truth and,tragically, there are lies -- lies conceived and spread for profit and power.We must be absolutely clear about what is true and what is a lie.And here is the truth: The former president of theUnited States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election. He's done so because he values power over principle, because he sees his own interests as more important than his country's interests and America's interests, and because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution.He can't accept he lost, even though that's what 93 United States senators, his own Attorney General, his own Vice President, governors and state officials in every battleground state have all said: He lost.That's what 81 million of you did as you voted for a new way forward.He has done what no president in American history -- the history of this country -- has ever, ever done: He refused to accept the results of an election and the will of the American people.While some courageous men and women in the Republican Party are standing against it, trying to uphold the principles of that party, too many others are transforming that party into something else. They seem no longer to want to be the party -- the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Reagan, the Bushes.But whatever my other disagreements are with Republicans who support the rule of law and not the rule of a single man, I will always seek to work together with them to find shared solutions where possible. Because if we have a shared belief in democracy, then anything is possible -- anything.And so, at this moment, we must decide: What kind of nation are we going to be?Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm?Are we going to be a nation where we allow partisan election officials to overturn the legally expressed will of the people?Are we going to be a nation that lives not by the light of the truth but in the shadow of lies?We cannot allow ourselves to be that kind of nation. The way forward is to recognize the truth and to live by it.The Big Lie being told by the former president and many Republicans who fear his wrath is that the insurrection in this country actually took place on Election Day -- November 3rd, 2020.Think about that. Is that what you thought? Is that what you thought when you voted that day? Taking part in an insurrection? Is that what you thought you were doing? Or did you think you were carrying out your highest duty as a citizen and voting?The former president and his supporters are trying to rewrite history. They want you to see Election Day as the day of insurrection and the riot that took place here on January 6th as the true expression of the will of the people.Can you think of a more twisted way to look at this country -- to look at America? I cannot.Here's the truth: The election of 2020 was the greatest demonstration of democracy in the history of this country.More of you voted in that election than have ever voted in all of American history. Over 150 million Americans went to the polls and voted that day in a pandemic -- some at grea- -- great risk to their lives. They should be applauded, not attacked.Right now, in state after state, new laws are being written -- not to protect the vote, but to deny it; not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert it; not to strengthen or protect our democracy, but because the former president lost.Instead of looking at the election results from 2020 and saying they need new ideas or better ideas to win more votes, the former president and his supporters have decided the only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert our elections.It's wrong. It's undemocratic. And frankly, it's un-American.The second Big Lie being told by the former President and his supporters is that the results of the election of 2020 can't be trusted.The truth is that no election -- no election in American history has been more closely scrutinized or more carefully counted.Every legal challenge questioning the results in every court in this country that could have been made was made and was rejected -- often rejected by Republican-appointed judges, including judges appointed by the former president himself, from state courts to the United States Supreme Court.Recounts were undertaken in state after state. Georgia -- Georgia counted its results three times, with one recount by hand.Phony partisan audits were undertaken long after the election in several states. None changed the results. And in some of them, the irony is the margin of victory actually grew slightly.So, let's speak plainly about what happened in 2020. Even before the first ballot was cast, the former presidentwas preemptively sowing doubt about the election results. He built his lie over months. It wasn't based on any facts. He was just looking for an excuse -- a pretext -- to cover for the truth.He's not just a former president. He's a defeated former president -- defeated by a margin of over 7 million of your votes in a full and free and fair election.There is simply zero proof the election results were inaccurate. In fact, in every venue where evidence had to be produced and an oath to tell the truth had to be taken, the former president failed to make his case.Just think about this: The former president and his supporters have never been able to explain how they accept as accurate the other election results that took place on November 3rd -- the elections for governor, United States Senate, the House of Representatives -- elections in which they closed the gap in the House.They challenge none of that. The President's name was first, then we went down the line -- governors, senators, House of Representatives. Somehow, those results were accurate on the same ballot, but the presidential race was flawed?And on the same ballot, the same day, cast by the same voters.The only difference: The former President didn't lose those races; he just lost the one that was his own.Finally, the third Big Lie being told by a former President and his supporters is that the mob who sought to impose their will through violence are the nation's true patriots.Is that what you thought when you looked at the mob ransacking the Capitol, destroying property, literally defecating in the hallways, rifling through desks of senators and representatives, hunting down members of congress? Patriots? Not in my view.To me, the true patriots were the more than 150 [million] Americans who peacefully expressed their vote at the ballot box, the election workers who protected the integrity of the vote, and the heroes who defended this Capitol.You can't love your country only when you win.You can't obey the law only when it's convenient.You can't be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies.Those who stormed this Capitol and those who instigated and incited and those who called on them to do so held a dagger at the throat of America -- at American democracy.They didn't come here out of patriotism or principle. They came here in rage -- not in service of America, but rather in service of one man.Those who incited the mob -- the real plotters -- who were desperate to deny the certification of the election and defy the will of the voters.But their plot was foiled. Congressmen -- Democrats and Republicans -- stayed. Senators, representatives, staff -- they finished their work the Constitution demanded. They honored their oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.Look, folks, now it's up to all of us -- to 'We the People' -- to stand for the rule of law, to preserve the flame of democracy, to keep the promise of America alive.That promise is at risk, targeted by the forces that value brute strength over the sanctity of democracy, fear over hope, personal gain over public good.Make no mistake about it: We're living at an inflection point in history.Both at home and abroad, we're engaged anew in a struggle between democracy and autocracy, between the aspirations of the many and the greed of the few, between the people's right of self-determination and self- -- the self-seeking autocrat.From China to Russia and beyond, they're betting that democracy's days are numbered. They've actually told me democracy is too slow, too bogged down by division to succeed in today's rapidly changing, complicated world.And they're betting -- they're betting America will become more like them and less like us. They're betting that America is a place for the autocrat, the dictator, the strongman.I do not believe that. That is not who we are. That is not who we have ever been. And that is not who we should ever, ever be.Our Founding Fathers, as imperfect as they were, set in motion an experiment that changed the world -- literally changed the world.Here in America, the people would rule, power would be transferred peacefully -- never at the tip of a spear or the barrel of a gun.And they committed to paper an idea that couldn't live up to -- they couldn't live up to but an idea that couldn't be constrained: Yes, in America all people are created equal.We reject the view that if you succeed, I fail; if you get ahead, I fall behind; if I hold you down, I somehow lift myself up.The former President, who lies about this election, and the mob that attacked this Capitol could not be further away from the core American values.They want to rule or they will ruin -- ruin what our country fought for at Lexington and Concord; at Gettysburg; at Omaha Beach; Seneca Falls; Selma, Alabama. What -- and what we were fighting for: the right to vote, the right to govern ourselves, the right to determine our own destiny.And with rights come responsibilities: the responsibility to see each other as neighbors -- maybe we disagree with that neighbor, but they're not an adversary; the responsibility to accept defeat then get back in the arena and try again the next time to make your case; the responsibility to see that America is an idea -- an idea that requires vigilant stewardship.As we stand here today -- one year since January 6th, 2021 -- the lies that drove the anger and madness we saw in this place, they have not abated.So, we have to be firm, resolute, and unyielding in our defense of the right to vote and to have that vote counted.Some have already made the ultimate sacrifice in this sacred effort.Jill and I have mourned police officers in this Capitol Rotunda not once but twice in the wake of January 6th: once to honor Officer Brian Sicknick, who lost his life the day after the attack, and a second time to honor Officer Billy Evans, who lost his life defending this Capitol as well.We think about the others who lost their lives and were injured and everyone living with the trauma of that day -- from those defending this Capitol to members of Congress in both parties and their staffs, to reporters, cafeteria workers, custodial workers, and their families.Don't kid yourself: The pain and scars from that day run deep.I said it many times and it's no more true or real than when we think about the events of January 6th: We are in a battle for the soul of America. A battle that, by the grace of God and the goodness and gracious -- and greatness of this nation, we will win.Believe me, I know how difficult democracy is. And I'm crystal clear about the threats America faces. But I also know that our darkest days can lead to light and hope.From the death and destruction, as the Vice President referenced, in Pearl Harbor came the triumph over the forces of fascism.From the brutality of Bloody Sunday on the Edmund Pettus Bridge came historic voting rights legislation.So, now let us step up, write the next chapter in American history where January 6th marks not the end of democracy, but the beginning of a renaissance of liberty and fair play.I did not seek this fight brought to this Capitol one year ago today, but I will not shrink from it either.I will stand in this breach. I will defend this nation. And I will allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy.We will make sure the will of the people is heard; that the ballot prevails, not violence; that authority in this nation will always be peacefully transferred.I believe the power of the presidency and the purpose is to unite this nation, not divide it; to lift us up, not tear us apart; to be about us -- about us, not about 'me.'Deep in the heart of America burns a flame lit almost 250 years ago -- of liberty, freedom, and equality.This is not a land of kings or dictators or autocrats. We're a nation of laws; of order, not chaos; of peace, not violence.Here in America, the people rule through the ballot, and their will prevails.So, let us remember: Together, we're one nation, under God, indivisible; that today, tomorrow, and forever, at our best, we are the United States of America.God bless you all. May God protect our troops. And may God bless those who stand watch over our democracy.  ",0.107
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10374455/Trump-chats-windmills-killing-birds-blames-Biden-decrease-vaccine-uptake.html,"Former President Donald Trump yesterday chatted about 'windmills killing birds' and blamed Joe Biden for a decrease in vaccine uptake - but ignored January 6 during an interview on the eve of the anniversary.Trump, speaking to Blaze TV's Glenn Beck in a special titled 'The January 6th Distraction', said one of the pitfalls of wind power was that turbines 'kill birds' and 'decimate landscapes'.    He blamed President Biden for a decrease in vaccine uptake, claiming the Democrat's jab mandates have damaged trust in the treatment and hurt the economy. Only Beck himself mentioned the last year's 'stupid' breach of the Capitol by pro-Trump protesters in the interview's introduction, describing the January 6 Committee as 'a complete sham' and a 'witch hunt'. He lambasted the left for using January 6 as an 'opportunity to demonize' Trump and said discussions around an investigation into the incident were distracting Americans from the real issues.  It comes after Trump yesterday issued a statement calling for MAGA supporters to 'rise up' against Democrat overreach and criticizing Biden's handling of the pandemic.Speaking about oil, Trump complained 'other technology does not have the power to fire up our plants.''Wind is extremely expensive and, by the way, the turbines are all made in Germany and they're all made in China - those two places.'He claimed turbines make little difference to 'dirty' air and 'atmospheric filth' - but added 'assuming you believe that'. The former president said wind turbines were 'very expensive, don't work... very intermittent' and said they do not 'have the power to do what you want to do'.    'And by the way, kills all your birds and ruins your, I mean these magnificent landscapes that are just being decimated by win.'He also lambasted solar energy which, he said, does not have sufficient power to provide electricity to US plants. He said the renewable energy was 'dirty' and said it was not a long term solution because solar panels have to be replaced 'every ten years'. The pair went on to discuss the Joe Biden's handling of the pandemic, with Trump complaining the Democratic president has not 'fixed anything'.   'Actually, he scared people from taking the vaccine, which is interesting,' he said. 'When I was there, we came up with [the vaccine] and everybody wanted it. When I left, people really didn't want it and then they do the mandates, which is terrible, shouldn't do it.'Asked whether he would have imposed a vaccine mandate, Trump said: 'No and they shouldn't have done it either. They scared everybody and they hurt the economy very badly. 'You know, the mandates are one of the reasons you can't get anybody to work for you. The mandates have been a disaster. 'I would like them to take the vaccine but they have to do it if they want it. There's plenty of people that would take it.'  Trump also touched on oil prices, which he wrongly claimed had hit $7.77 per gallon in California - one station in Gorda has reportedly charged $7.59 in recent months, though it is thought this is because it is 40 miles from the next gas station.He blamed the Biden administration's decision to reverse his policy to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the high prices.   The former president also spoke about the origins of Covid-19 and said he had stopped funding of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which has been blamed for leaking the deadly virus. He also claimed he had ignored advice given by Dr Fauci, who he described as 'not a great doctor' but 'a great promoter'.'Everything he wanted, I didn't do,' Trump said, claiming that Dr Fauci is 'totally controlling Biden'.   The comments come after he released a statement yesterday calling for MAGA supporters to 'rise up'  in a statement that raised eyebrows on the eve of the anniversary of the Capitol riot.  Trump had planned to hold a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Thursday, but was warned against it by his allies, who felt it was provocative and likely to be damaging.Instead, he issued a statement criticizing Joe Biden's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.  'Now, there's talk by the Biden Administration again about closing schools and even vaccine mandates for school children,' Trump said. 'This is an outrage, and MAGA nation should rise up and oppose this egregious federal government overreach.' Joe Biden will speak from the Capitol this morning.The White House said Biden would push back against Trump's claims, adopted by many of his followers, that his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud, as well as attempts to downplay the violence of the worst assault on the Capitol since the War of 1812.On Wednesday evening, Trump launched a scathing attack on his successor, but with no reference to the anniversary. 'The Democrats are so incredibly mandate happy,' Trump said.'The Biden Administration's response to COVID is getting worse every day. Joe Biden said, 'there is no federal solution' to the pandemic, but he then federalized the distribution of antibodies, and red states are getting the short end of the stick. 'In my administration, we respected the role of Governors to take care of their own states, and they could request antibodies and therapeutics depending on what they needed. That's the way our Country is supposed to be run.'Trump then boasted about his own government creating 'vaccines in record time', but said mandates were wrong.'People should be able to choose how they want to govern their own health. The federal government must be reined in and give the people back the freedom to decide whether they want to be vaccinated or not.'Joe Biden said he would never issue mandates, but he did it anyway like so many other things.'",0.075

The coalition said in a statement there was minor damage.On Monday, two armed drones were shot down as they headed toward a facility housing U.S. advisors at Baghdad airport. Photos obtained by AFP from the coalition official show remains of one of the drones, with the message 'commanders' revenge operations' written on it in Arabic. Two explosives-laden drones targeting an Iraqi military base housing U.S. troops in western Anbar province were destroyed on Tuesday at the Al Asad air base.The January 3, 2020 US strike killed Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy leader of the Iran-backed Hashed al-Shaabi coalition of armed groups. Soleimani, commonly known as the second-most powerful man in Iran and tipped as a future president, was so badly maimed in the strike that he had to be identified by a large ring he wore on his finger.Initial retaliation began days after the bombing, when Iran responded by firing missiles at bases hosting US troops in Iraq. No one was killed but Washington said dozens suffered traumatic brain injuries.Amid the heightened tensions Iran also accidentally downed a Ukrainian passenger jet on January 8, 2020, killing all 176 people aboard.The US-led coalition formally ended its combat mission supporting Iraqi forces in the ongoing fight against the Islamic State group last month. Some 2,500 troops will remain as the coalition shifts to an advisory mission to continue supporting Iraqi forces.Qassem Soleimani was one of the most popular figures in Iran and seen as a deadly adversary by America and its allies.The 62-year-old head of the Quds, or Jerusalem, Force of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, Soleimani shaped Tehran's foreign policy throughout the Middle East. US officials say the Guard under Soleimani taught Iraqi militants how to manufacture and use especially deadly roadside bombs against US troops after the invasion of Iraq. Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution swept the shah from power and Soleimani joined the Revolutionary Guard in its wake. He deployed to Iran's northwest with forces that put down Kurdish unrest following the revolution. In 1980, Iraq invaded Iran and began the two countries long, bloody eight-year war.Soleimani became known for his opposition to 'meaningless deaths' on the battlefield, while still weeping at times with fervor when exhorting his men into combat, embracing each individually. Soleimani's charisma propelled him to the senior officer ranks. In 1998, he was named commander of the Quds Force.  His profile rose suddenly when he was pushed forward as the public face of Iran's intervention in the Syrian conflict from 2013, appearing in battlefield photos, documentaries - and even being featured in a music video and animated film.Western leaders saw him as central to Iran's ties with militia groups including Lebanon's Hezbollah and Palestinian Hamas.",0.026
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10372213/Stephanie-Grisham-meet-January-6-committee-TONIGHT.html,"Melania Trump's ex-Chief of Staff Stephanie Grisham met behind closed doors Wednesday night with the House select committee on January 6. Grisham was spotted outside a House office building leaving the Capitol Hill meeting, telling reporters she 'cooperated fully' with the Democrat-led group, according to ABC News.    Grisham, who also served as press secretary to former President Donald Trump, was the first high-level aide to quit during the attack on the Capitol. In her memoir, I'll Take Your Questions Now: What I Saw at the Trump White House, she said it was Melania Trump's ambivalence that inspired her to resign. Grisham wrote that she had sent the first lady a text: 'Do you want to tweet that peaceful protests are the right of every American, but there is no place for lawlessness and violence?''No,' Melania Trump wrote back. The first lady was in the middle of a photoshoot, capturing some of the White House's rugs. CNN reported Wednesday that Grisham decided to speak to the Democrat-led committee after speaking to Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin by phone. A source told the network that Grisham and Raskin had an in-depth phone call where she detailed what happened behind-the-scenes on January 6. The source said Grisham was 'candid' about what happened at the White House that day and shared knowledge of conversations with President Trump. The January 6 select committee is investigating what Trump knew when, as he didn't call off the attack from his supporters for several hours. In the meantime he received text messages from top allies, some trapped in the Capitol, and family members, including Donald Trump Jr., asking him to condemn the violence publicly, according to messages that have been made public by the committee. In her book, Grisham wrote about how Melania Trump had 'often been the sensible one,' noting how she came out before her husband to condemn the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017. Grisham had pushed back 'on the caricature of Melania Trump as some sort of Marie Antoinette, cold and cruel and oblivious to the little people over whom her husband ruled.'  But after she responded 'no' to Grisham, the aide wrote that she 'finally saw the doomed French queen. Dismissive. Defeated. Detached.' 'It broke me,' Grisham wrote. 'I took a breath and waited another minute. You learned to do that in the Trump White House: make sure you are grounded and not acting out of the moment. Then I resigned.' 'I sent her an email and cc-ed her senior adviser so I couldn't take it back or be talked out of it. I was done,' Grisham said. ",0.039
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10372423/Biden-call-Trump-singular-responsibility-Capitol-riot-carnage.html,"President Joe Biden will call out Donald Trump as the 'singular responsibility' behind the January 6th insurrection when he travels to Capitol Hill Thursday to mark the one year anniversary of the day.Biden will hold Trump responsible for the 'chaos and carnage' of that day, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at her press briefing on Wednesday. Five people died in the aftermath of the Trump's supporters storming the building, which caused thousands of dollars worth of damage throughout the Capitol complex.Biden will 'lay out the significance of what happened in the Capitol and the singular responsibility President Trump has for the chaos and carnage that we saw and he will forcibly push back on the lies spread by the former president in an attempt to mislead the American people and his own supporters as well as distract from his role in what happened,' Psaki said. The Biden administration has been reluctant to directly discuss Trump particularly given that the former president continues the false claim that he won the 2020 presidential election.Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will speak in Statuary Hall in the Capitol building on Thursday to mark the anniversary. On January 6th, Trump supporters ran through that room on their way to the House chamber, where they failed to breach the security doors.Psaki also went after members of the Republican Party who have supported Trump's lie that he was the presidential victor. 'What you'll hear the president talking about tomorrow is the fact that you don't just love your country when you win,' she told Dailymail.com. 'You love your country, you love democracy in any in any scenario, and what is most disappointing to him is that there has been a silence and, at times, a complacency by far too many Republicans who have sat by and defended the big lie and perpetuated misinformation to the American public.'Psaki did not mince words in her press briefing about the administration's view of Trump. The former president addressed his supporters outside the White House on January 6, 2021 before they marched on the Capitol and tried to stop the certification of Biden's victory. House Democrats impeached Trump for his role but he was acquitted by the Senate. Biden has been 'clear eyed about the threat the former president represents to our democracy and how the former president constantly works to constantly undermine basic American values and rule of law,' Psaki said.She noted that Biden sees January 6th as a 'tragic culmination of what those four years under President Trump did to our country.'Trump canceled a planned press conference for January 6th. Democrats, meanwhile, are ramping up their probe of the January 6th insurrection ahead of Thursday's one-year anniversary, considering 'Watergate-style' prime-time hearings with a bold-faced witness wish list that includes Mike Pence and Sean Hannity.Speaker Nancy Pelosi has a day-long slate of events planned for the one-year anniversary of the MAGA riot on Thursday, including a moment of silence on the House floor, testimony from lawmakers about their experience that day, and a prayer vigil on the steps of the Capitol.  'These events are intended as an observance of reflection, remembrance and recommitment, in a spirit of unity, patriotism and prayerfulness,' Pelosi wrote in a letter to lawmakers.  Republicans, who have not revealed their plans for how they will mark the day, accused Democrats of grandstanding.'I think they will try to politicize the event,' Republican Senator John Thune said.In a bid capitalize on the anniversary, Democrats on committee are looking to crank up the pace of their probe and draw a massive audience with prime-time hearings. 9 am: President Biden and Vice President Harris deliver remarks in National Statuary Hall in the Capitol10 am: Speaker Nancy Pelosi hold a closed-press Moment of Reflection on the House floor12 pm: A statement from Speaker Pelosi and a Moment of Silence on the House Floor 1 pm: Dr. Carla Hayden, Librarian of Congress; Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin; and Historian Jon Meacham moderate a conversation with Speaker Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer2:30 pm: Democratic Rep. Jason Crow leads lawmakers in giving testimonials about what they experienced on January 6th5:30 pm: Pelosi and Schumer lead a Bicameral Prayer Vigil on Capitol Center Steps'I have favored this strategy from the beginning,' Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, a member of the panel, told MSNBC's Morning Joe on Wednesday. He said he wanted a Watergate-style approach, when the 1973 hearings into Richard Nixon's presidency captivated America. At one point an estimated 85% of the country was tuned in to them.'I remember as a kid getting to watch a bit of the Watergate hearings, which were a daily spectacle that the whole country tuned into,' Raskin said. 'If we can do that for, you know, a break-in in a couple of offices in the Watergate hotel, certainly, we can do it for a massive break-in into the Capitol of the United States, a storming, and a seizure essentially of our government offices, an interruption of the peaceful transfer of power.'Those prime-time hearings could occur in late March or early April, Rep. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, told Bloomberg News.But no date has been set yet. 'We're working toward that,' Thompson said. Those hearings would also feature high-profile witnesses, which would help them gain maximum exposure. Among those names beiing considered are former Vice President Mike Pence and Fox News host Sean Hannity.Pence was under heavy pressure from then-President Donald Trump to declare the 2020 election results invalid, wipe out Joe Biden's victory and secure him a second term. The vice president has the symbolic role of presiding over the Electoral College certification of results. Pence was a target of the January 6th rioters, some of who threatened to hang him, and was evacuated from the Senate floor as the MAGA supporters stormed the Capitol.Thompson told CNN that he and the panel would like to hear from Pence.'I would hope that he would do the right thing and come forward and voluntarily talk to the committee,' he said.'We have not formally asked. But if he offered, we'd gladly accept. Everything is under consideration,' he added. So far, in its investigation, the committee has interviewed more than 300 witnesses, announced more than 50 subpoenas, obtained more than 35,000 pages of records and received hundreds of telephone tips through their Jan. 6 tipline, according to a tally by The Washington Post. Names are starting to be lined up for hearings. The panel on Tuesday asked longtime Trump supporter Sean Hannity to appear as a 'fact witness' in their investigation, noting how the Fox star was 'expressing concerns and providing advice to the president and White House staff.' The committee released several texts Hannity sent to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.'I'm very worried about the next 48 hours,' Hannity wrote on the eve of January 6th.On January 5, the eve of the Capitol attack, Hannity also texted to Meadows, 'Pence pressure. WH counsel will leave.' In the letter to Hannity, Thompson wrote the texts suggest 'that you had knowledge of concerns by President Trump's White House Counsel's Office regarding the legality of the former President's plans for January 6th.' 'These facts are directly relevant to our inquiry,' Thompson told Hannity. Thompson also said that Hannity appeared to have 'detailed knowledge regarding President Trump's state of mind in the days following the January 6th attack.' One of Hannity's texts indicated he had a discussion with Trump on January 10 and it left the Fox News host concerned in the lead-up to President Joe Biden's January 20 inauguration. 'Guys, we have a clear path to land the plane in 9 days,' Hannity informed Meadows and Republican Rep. Jim Jordan. 'He can't mention the election again. Ever. I did not have a good call with him today. And worse, I'm not sure what is left to do or say, and I don't like not knowing if it's truly understood. Ideas?' On his Fox News show on Tuesday evening, Hannity launched into a stinging rebuke of DC officials and their 'willing accomplices' but didn't mention the letter from the House committee investigating the MAGA riot.'I have an important message to all you elected swamp creatures in Washington, D.C., your willing accomplices, your press secretaries in the media mob,' he began. 'It is frankly repulsive, just repulsive that all of you sycophants, you sit idly by, you say nothing, you do nothing, as Joe Biden completely mismanages COVID-19,' he said.Republicans have not revealed their plans for how they will mark the one-year anniversary of the riot.Many Republican lawmakers criticized Trump in the immediate wake of January 6th - some even called him that day to encourage him to try and call off the rioters. But, many of them also have made amends with the former president in the months following particularly as Trump continues to hold a tight grip on Republican base.  Many Republican senators, including Leader Mitch McConnell, will be in Atlanta for the funeral of former Senator Johnny Isakson on Thursday. Earlier this week, members of the House panel indicated they had received testimony from inside Trump's West Wing from January 6th that focuses on Trump's failure to do more to stop the rioters. Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the panel, revealed there was 'firsthand' testimony that Ivanka Trump twice asked her father to call off the rioters. 'We know members of his family, we know his daughter - we have firsthand testimony that his daughter Ivanka went in at least twice to ask him to please stop this violence,' Cheney said Sunday on ABC's This Week.Ivanka reportedly referred to the insurrection as an 'optics issue' as it was taking place, according to Michael Wolff's latest Trump book Landslide.  She tried to stop the riot herself, tweeting: 'American Patriots - any security breach or disrespect to our law enforcement is unacceptable. The violence must stop immediately. Please be peaceful.' The tweet has since been deleted. Meanwhile, the House committee has been rebuffed by several former Trump aides or advisers whose testimony was sought by subpoena.That includes former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and Meadows. Bannon has been indicted for criminal contempt of Congress for refusing to testify to the panel and awaits trial in July. The House in December voted to hold Meadows in contempt, referring the case to the Justice Department. ",0.067
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10372393/Psaki-rejects-criticism-Biden-saying-pandemic-unvaccinated.html,"The White House stepped in to defend President Biden on Wednesday after he was criticized for characterizing the COVID-19 crisis as a 'pandemic of the unvaccinated' despite thousands of breakthrough cases.A former White House testing czar said the president's words were simply 'false' and might undermine public health efforts.  The White House defended the president, saying that the unvaccinated were far more likely to suffer hospitalization or death.Press Secretary Jen Psaki said: 'We also know that you are 17 times more likely to die of COVID if you're not vaccinated, and 20 times more likely to be hospitalized.'So I think in terms of the impact. the dire impact on people across the country, we should be very clear about the impact of not getting vaccinated - people who will be be hurt, be hospitalized and face the threat of death the most, and those are the people who are unvaccinated,' she said.The Omicron wave has set records for cases in the US, hitting one million new infections on Monday.Schools and businesses have been forced to close, and airlines have canceled hundreds of flights during the winter wave.Biden offered an update on Tuesday, warning the nation of 'challenging' weeks ahead and urging unvaccinated Americans to get their shots.  'There is no excuse - no excuse for anyone being unvaccinated. This continues to be a pandemic of the unvaccinated,' he said before a meeting of his response team.But that characterization has been challenged by critics who point out that vaccinated people may be protected against severe symptoms but that Omicron has increased the rate of breakthrough infections. Donald Trump's COVID testing czar was among them.Brett Giroir, who was part of the White House coronavirus task force, told Fox News: 'I think it's a disservice to say it's just ... the unvaccinated because it's telling the vaccinated that you don't have a problem, you're not subject to Omicron and that's false.'The Omicron variant caused an estimated 95 percent of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. during the week ending January 1, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).In about a month, Omicron has gone from causing under one percent of cases to over 90 percent of cases - outcompeting the previously-dominant Delta variant.The CDC's variant data come from a modeling system that estimates current variant prevalence from weeks-old sequencing data.Last week, the CDC revised down its estimate for the share of cases caused by Omicron in mid-December, from 73 percent to 22 percent.The revision, followed by this week's higher number, shows how the U.S.'s patchy genetic surveillance system is falling behind in tracking this highly contagious variant.The Omicron variant was first identified in South Africa, Botswana, and Hong Kong in late November.This variant caught scientists' attention for its high number of mutations and ability to spread more rapidly than any other strain of the coronavirus.In the weeks since it was identified, Omicron has driven record case numbers in the U.S. and around the world.Omicron has a 'substantial growth advantage over Delta,' according to the World Health Organization.The variant was first identified in the U.S. shortly after Thanksgiving, though CDC data now show that it was already spreading during the holiday. Data from New York suggests the highly infectious variant is causing five times as many cases in vaccinated people as previous forms of the virus.Calling it a 'pandemic of the unvaccinated' risked fostering a sense of complacency among the vaccinated, said Giroir.'So it's not only incorrect information, I think it's doing a disservice to public health by blaming it on the unvaccinated people,' he said.'This is a problem we all have to face ... vaccinated unvaccinated, we need to get our booster, we need to have plans that if we do get sick, particularly in a high-risk group, that we can get antibodies or we can get those oral antiviral therapies.'Giroir, a former four-star admiral in the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, was appointed testing czar by Trump. He also served as assistant secretary of health.The White House defended the president's words.Press Secretary Jen Psaki said: 'We also know that you are 17 times more likely to die of COVID If you're not vaccinated, and 20 times more likely to be hospitalized. ,'So I think in terms of the impact. the dire impact on people across the country, we should be very clear about the impact of not getting vaccinated - people who will be be hurt, be hospitalised and face the threat of death the most, and those are the people who are unvaccinated,' she said.The administration is under intense pressure for failing to bring the pandemic under control amid shortages of tests.In his remarks on Tuesday, Biden tried to offer reassurance that the country was better placed to cope than it was a year ago. He said people should be 'concerned' about Omicron but not 'alarmed.''I know we’re all tired and frustrated about the pandemic,' he said. 'These coming weeks are going to be challenging. Please wear your mask in public to protect yourself and others.'We’re going to get through this. We’re going to get through it together.'On Tuesday the US recorded 869,187 new cases, down from the record set on Monday but higher than any other day since the pandemic began. The country's seven-day rolling average of new cases stood at 565,042, a 114 percent increase from a week ago, according to a DailyMail.com analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University. However, deaths remain relatively low, with 2,384 new deaths on Tuesday, a decline of 13 percent from week-ago levels on a rolling average basis. Hospitalizations are rising, but remain well below their peak last January.The wildly transmissible Omicron variant, which appears milder particularly among vaccinated individuals, is fueling the surge in cases, but experts say the wave could burn out within the month and fall off quickly.On Wednesday, Center for Disease Control director Rochelle Walensky confirmed that the agency estimated that the Omicron variant now represents 95 percent of all cases across the US, and Delta makes up the remaining 5 percent. 'The sharp rise in cases and the emergence of the more transmissible Omicron variant emphasizes the importance of vaccinations and boosters,' she said. ",0.056
