Thank you and welcome back to ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY.""DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\xa0 Thank you very much.WALLACE:\xa0 Let\'s start with the surge of the coronavirus across the country in recent months. You still talk about it as, quote, ""burning embers."" But I want to put up a chart that shows where we are with the illness over the last four months. As you can see, we hit a peak here in April, 36,000 cases...TRUMP:\xa0 Cases.WALLACE:\xa0 ... a day.TRUMP:\xa0 Yes, cases.WALLACE:\xa0 Then -- then it went down and now since June, it has gone up more than double. One day this week 75,000 new cases.\xa0 More than double...TRUMP:\xa0 Chris, that\'s because we have great testing, because we have the best testing in the world. If we didn\'t test, you wouldn\'t be able to show that chart. If we tested half as much, those numbers would be down.WALLACE:\xa0 But -- but this isn\'t burning embers, sir? This is a forest fire.TRUMP:\xa0 No, no. But I don\'t say -- I say flames, we\'ll put out the flames. And we\'ll put out in some cases just burning embers. We also have burning embers. We have embers and we do have flames. Florida became more flame like, but it\'s -- it\'s going to be under control.And, you know, it\'s not just this country, it’s many countries. We don\'t talk about it in the news. They don\'t talk about Mexico and Brazil and still parts of Europe, which actually got hit sooner than us, so it\'s a little ahead of us in that sense.But you take a look, why don\'t they talk about Mexico?\xa0 Which is not helping us. And all I can say is thank God I built most of the wall, because if I didn\'t have the wall up we would have a much bigger problem with Mexico.WALLACE:\xa0 But, sir, we have the seventh highest mortality rate in the world. Our mortality rate is higher than Brazil, it\'s higher than Russia and the European Union has us on a travel ban.TRUMP:\xa0 Yeah. I think what we\'ll do -- well, we have them under travel ban too, Chris. I closed them off. If you remember, I was the one that did the European Union very early. But when you talk about mortality rates, I think it\'s the opposite. I think we have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world.WALLACE:\xa0 That’s not true, sir. We, we, we have a -- we had 900 deaths on a single day...TRUMP:\xa0 We will take a look...WALLACE:\xa0 ... just this week...TRUMP:\xa0 Ready?WALLACE:\xa0 You, you can check it out.TRUMP:\xa0 Can you please get me the mortality rate?TRUMP:\xa0 Kayleigh\'s right here. I heard we have one of the lowest, maybe the lowest mortality rate anywhere in the world. TRUMP: Do you have the numbers, please? Because I heard we had the best mortality rate. TRUMP: Number, number one low mortality rate. TRUMP: I hope you show the scenario because it shows what fake news is all about. Ok, go ahead.WALLACE: OK, OK. I don’t think I’m fake news but I will -- we’ll put --TRUMP: Yeah, you will --WALLACE: -- put our stats on --TRUMP: You said we had the worst mortality rate in the world --WALLACE: I said you had --TRUMP: -- and we have the best.WALLACE VOICE OVER: All right. It’s a little complicated. But bear with us.\xa0 We went with numbers from Johns Hopkins University which charted the mortality rate for 20 countries hit by the virus. The US ranked 7th better than the United Kingdom but worse than Brazil and Russia. WALLACE VOICE OVER: The White House went with this chart from the European CDC which shows Italy and Spain doing worse. But countries like Brazil and South Korea doing better. Other countries doing better like Russia aren’t included in the White House chart.WALLACE: California locking down again. Florida, deadliest day of the entire pandemic. Hospitals at capacity at a number of places around the country. Shortages of testing, shortages of personal protective equipment for nurses and doctors.A lot of people say this is because we don\'t have a national plan. You talk about states. We don\'t have a national plan. Do you take responsibility for that?TRUMP:\xa0 Look, I take responsibility always for everything because it\'s ultimately my job, too. I have to get everybody in line.Some governors have done well, some governors have done poorly. They\'re supposed to have supplies they didn\'t have. I supplied everybody.Now we have somewhat of a surge in certain areas. And other areas we\'re doing great. But we have a surge in certain areas. But you don\'t hear people complaining about ventilators. We\'ve got all the ventilators we can use. We\'re supplying them to other countries. We go out into parking lots and everything, everybody gets a test. We find -- if we did half the testing -- with all of that being said, I\'m glad we did it. This is the right way to do it. I\'m glad we did what we\'re doing. But we have more tests by far than any country in the world.WALLACE:\xa0 But, sir, testing is up 37 percent.TRUMP:\xa0 Well, that\'s good.WALLACE:\xa0 I understand. Cases are up 194 percent. It isn\'t just that testing has gone up, it\'s that the virus has spread. The positivity rate has increased. There – the virus is…TRUMP:\xa0 Many of those cases...WALLACE:\xa0 ... worse than it was.TRUMP:\xa0 Many of those cases are young people that would heal in a day. They have the sniffles and we put it down as a test. Many of them -- don\'t forget, I guess it\'s like 99.7 percent, people are going to get better and in many cases they\'re going to get better very quickly.We go out and we look and then on the news -- look if you go back to the news, all of your -- even your wonderful competitors, you\'ll see cases are up. Cases are up -- many of those cases shouldn\'t even be cases. Cases are up because we have the best testing in the world and we have the most testing.No country has ever done what we\'ve done in terms of testing. We are the envy of the world. They call and they say the most incredible job anybody\'s done is our job on testing, because we\'re going to very shortly be up to 50 million tests.You look at other countries; they don\'t even do tests. They do tests if somebody walks into the hospital, they\'re sick, they\'re really sick, they test them then, or they\'ll test them in a doctor\'s office. But they don\'t go around have massive areas of testing and we do. And I\'m glad we do, but it really skews the numbers.WALLACE:\xa0I’m, I\'m going to do you a favor, because I\'m sure a lot of people listening right now are going to say, ""Trump, he tries to play it down, he tries to make it not being as serious as it is.""TRUMP:\xa0 I don\'t play it -- I\'m not playing -- no, this is very serious.WALLACE:\xa0 75,000 cases a day.TRUMP:\xa0 Show me the death chart.WALLACE:\xa0 Well, I don\'t have the death chart.TRUMP:\xa0 Well, the death chart is much more important.WALLACE:\xa0 But I can tell you, the death chart is a thousand cases a day.TRUMP:\xa0 Excuse me, it\'s all too much, it shouldn\'t be one case. It came from China. They should\'ve never let it escape. They should\'ve never let it out. But it is what it is. Take a look at Europe, take a look at the numbers in Europe. And by the way, they\'re having cases.WALLACE:\xa0I can tell you cases are 6,000 in the whole European Union.TRUMP:\xa0 They don\'t test. They don\'t test.WALLACE:\xa0 Is it possible that they don\'t have the virus as badly as we do?TRUMP:\xa0 It\'s possible that they don\'t test, that\'s what\'s possible. We find cases and many of those cases heal automatically. We\'re finding -- in a way, we\'re creating trouble. Certainly, we are creating trouble for the fake news to come along and say, ""Oh, we have more cases.""Look, we do something that nobody\'s ever done. Not only the ventilators, where we\'re supplying them all over the world. We did a testing program the likes of which nobody\'s ever done before.WALLACE: The head of the CDC, Dr. Redfield, said this on Tuesday. TAPE: July 14, 2020DR. ROBERT REDFIELD, CDC DIRECTOR: ""I do think this fall and winter of 2020, 2021, are probably going to be one of the most difficult times that we’ve experienced in American public health.""WALLACE: Do you agree with Dr. Redfield?TRUMP:\xa0 I don\'t know and I don\'t think he knows. I don\'t think anybody knows with this. This is a very tricky deal. Everybody thought this summer it would go away and it would come back in the fall. Well, when the summer came, they used to say the heat -- the heat was good for it and it really knocks it out, remember? And then it might come back in the fall. So they got that one wrong.They -- they got a lot wrong. They got a lot wrong. The World Health got a tremendous amount wrong. They basically did whatever China wanted them to. And we\'ll save now almost $500 million a year, which is nice. But the World Health got a lot wrong.WALLACE:\xa0But, this is one of the sharpest criticisms of you.TRUMP: I agree.WALLACE: People say that you talk about the world as you’d like to see it rather than follow the science.TRUMP: No, I… WALLACE:\xa0Well – let me just, let me just ask the question, sir. Why on earth would your administration be involved in a campaign at this point to discredit Dr. Fauci, who is the nation\'s top infectious disease expert.TRUMP:\xa0 Because we\'re not. If one man from my administration doesn\'t like him because he made a few mistakes -- look, Dr. Fauci said, ""Don\'t wear a mask."" Dr. Fauci told me not to ban China, it would be a big mistake. I did it over and above his recommendation. Dr. Fauci then said, ""You saved tens of thousands of lives"" -- more than that. He said, ""You saved tens of thousands of lives.""Dr. Fauci\'s made some mistakes. But I have a very good -- I spoke to him yesterday at length. I have a very good relationship with Dr. Fauci.WALLACE:\xa0 But -- but, sir, this week -- this weekend, your White House put out a series of statements, so-called mistakes that Dr. Fauci had made. One of your closest aids -- one of your right-hand men, Daniel Scavino, put out this -- you\'ve seen this? TRUMP: Well Dr., look, look…WALLACE: Dr. – Dr. – ‘Dr. Faucet,’ which shows him as a leaker and an alarmist. TRUMP:\xa0 Well, I don\'t know that he’s a leaker …. WALLACE: Why, why would you do that?TRUMP: He\'s a little bit of an alarmist. That\'s OK. A little bit of an alarmist.WALLACE:\xa0 He\'s a bit of an alarmist?TRUMP:\xa0 A little bit of an alarmist. Let’s – let me just say. Dr. Fauci at the beginning – and again, I have a great relationship with him. I spoke with him at length yesterday. Dr. Fauci at the beginning said, “This will pass. Don’t worry about it. This will pass.” He was wrong. Dr. Fauci said, “Don’t ban China. Don’t ban China.” I did. He then admitted that I was right.WALLACE:\xa0 But you made mistakes, too.TRUMP:\xa0 I guess everybody makes mistakes.WALLACE:\xa0I was going to say, you said at one point… TAPE: January 22, 2020TRUMP: It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine. TAPE: February 26, 2020TRUMP: When you have 15 people. And the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that\'s a pretty good job we\'ve done. TAPE: July 1, 2020TRUMP: I think we\'re gonna be very good with the coronavirus. I think that at some point that\'s going to sort of just disappear. I hope.TRUMP: I\'ll be right eventually. I will be right eventually. You know I said, ""It\'s going to disappear."" I\'ll say it again.WALLACE: But does that – does that discredit you? TRUMP: It\'s going to disappear and I\'ll be right. I don’t think so.WALLACE:\xa0Right.TRUMP:\xa0 I don\'t think so. I don\'t think so. You know why? Because I\'ve been right probably more than anybody else.WALLACE: Then there are masks. From the first day that the CDC said that people should wear masks on April 3rd, you said you weren’t going to. You wore a mask for the first time in public…TRUMP: Yes.WALLACE: …at Walter Reed this weekend. Question, the CDC says if everybody wore a mask for 4-6 weeks, we could get this under control. Do you regret not wearing a mask in public from the start, and would you consider – will you consider a national mandate that people need to wear masks?TRUMP: No I want people to have a certain freedom, and I don’t believe in that. No, and I don’t agree with the statement that if everybody wear a mask everything disappears. Hey, Dr. Fauci said don’t wear a mask. Our Surgeon General – terrific guy – said don’t wear a mask.Everybody who is saying don’t wear a mask – all of sudden everybody’s got to wear a mask, and as you know masks cause problems, too. With that being said, I’m a believer in masks. I think masks are good.But I leave it up to the governors. Many of the governors are changing. They’re more mask into – they like the concept of masks, but some of them don’t agree. I do say this – schools have to open.Young people have to go to school, and there’s problems when you don’t go to school, too. And there’s going to be a funding problem because we’re not going to fund – when they don’t open their schools. We’re not going to fund them. We’re not going to give them money if they’re not going to school. If they don’t open.WALLACE: Two points on that. First of all, what the Federal government gives is only – is 8 percent.TRUMP: Ten percent and you know what – that’s a lot of money.WALLACE: And you’re going to take – do you know where the money goes? It goes overwhelmingly to disadvantaged kids and children with disabilities.TRUMP: Let the schools –WALLACE: Why wouldn’t you put -- send more money so the schools would be safer?TRUMP: Chris, let the schools open. Do you ever see the statistics on young people below the age of 18? The state of New Jersey had thousands of deaths.Of all of these thousands, one person below the age of 18 – in the entire state – one person and that was a person that had, I believe he said diabetes.One person below the age of 18 died in the state of New Jersey during all of this – you know, they had a hard time. And they’re doing very well now, so that’s it.WALLACE: The stimulus bill is running out at the end of this month.TRUMP: Yes.WALLACE: The Republicans say they want liability limits, which the Democrats don’t like. You say that you want a payroll tax cut, which even some Republicans are cool to.TRUMP: But a lot of Republicans like it, though.WALLACE: Will you only sign a bill that has those two provisions?TRUMP: Well, we’re going to see. But we do need protections because businesses are going to get sued just because somebody walked in. You don’t know where this virus comes from. They’ll sit down at a restaurant. They’ll sue the restaurant, the guy’s out of business.WALLACE: Right.TRUMP: So we do need some kind of immunity.\xa0 You do need it just like you need immunity for the police, OK, whether they like it or not. You need immunity for the police. But they do need a form of immunity. You don’t know if they caught it. And nobody’s ever going to be able to prove it one way or the other.You can’t put these – you know, the people that – look, the Democrats don’t want to do that because they’re total – they’re totally captured by the lobby of lawyers. The lawyers’ lobby is probably the most powerful in the country.WALLACE: What about the payroll tax cut?TRUMP: I want to see it. I want to see it.WALLACE: And if it isn’t in the bill?TRUMP: I’ll have to see but, yeah, I would consider not signing it if we don’t have a payroll tax cut, yes.WALLACE: Hot enough for you here, Mr. President?TRUMP: It’s hot. It’s about, well, sort of almost record breaking stuff.WALLACE: You know, we wanted to do it inside. This is your choice.TRUMP: But I wanted you to sweat a little bit.(LAUGHTER)WALLACE: Well, we both are. There has been a spike in violent crime in America in recent weeks. We’ve seen deaths up in New York, deaths up in Chicago, shootings. How do you explain it and what are you going to do about it?TRUMP: I explain it very simply by saying that they’re Democrat-run cities, they are liberally run. They are stupidly run. We have forced them in Seattle to end the CHOP because, you know, we were going in that following day. You probably have heard it. We were getting ready to go in. We were all set, and when they heard that we were going they set their police force.WALLACE: Liberal Democrats have been running cities in this country for decades.TRUMP: Poorly.WALLACE: Why is it so bad right now?TRUMP: They run them poorly, it was always bad but now it’s gotten totally out of control and it’s really because they want to defund the police. And Biden wants to defund the police.WALLACE: No he, sir, he does not.TRUMP: Look. He signed a charter with Bernie Sanders; I will get that one just like I was right on the mortality rate. Did you read the charter that he agreed to with…WALLACE: It says nothing about defunding the police.TRUMP: Oh really? It says abolish, it says -- let’s go. Get me the charter, please.WALLACE: All right.TRUMP: Chris, you’ve got to start studying for these.WALLACE: He says defund the police?TRUMP: He says defund the police. They talk about abolishing the police. They talk about illegal aliens pouring …WALLACE: I look, I look forward – I look forward to seeing that.WALLACE: Meanwhile, the George Floyd murder has reignited the issue of racism in policing in this country. I want to give you a couple of statistics. Nationwide blacks are twice as likely, fewer in absolute numbers, but in terms of per capita, blacks are twice as likely to be shot and killed by police as whites are. In Minneapolis, over the last five years, police used force against blacks at a rate seven times that against whites.Can you understand why blacks would be angry at that?TRUMP: Of course I do. Of course I do. Many whites are killed also. You have to say that.WALLACE: I understand that.TRUMP: I mean, many, many whites are killed. I hate the sad – but this is going on for decades. This is going on for a long time, long before I got here. You know, if you look at what’s gone on in Portland, those are anarchists and we’ve taken a very tough stand. If we didn’t take a stand in Portland, you know we’ve arrested many of these leaders. If we didn’t take that stand, right now you would have a problem like you, you – they were going to lose Portland. So let’s see…WALLACE: Ok, let’s see.TRUMP: …what this says here: Prosecutions, sanctuary cities, incentivize illegal aliens, expand asylum, abolish immigration detention –WALLACE: That’s not –TRUMP: No. I, I – we’ll find it.WALLACE: Ok.TRUMP: This thing is many pages long.TRUMP: End prosecution of illegal border crossers. Support deathly -- and these are the worse things, sanctuary cities –WALLACE: Sir, I’m not, I’m not, I’m not disagreeing with you on any of those. I’m disagreeing about defund police –(WALLACE VOICE OVER: The White House never sent us evidence the Bernie-Biden platform calls for defunding or abolishing police—because there is none.\xa0 It calls for increased funding for police departments--that meet certain standards. Biden has called for redirecting some police funding for related programs—like mental health counseling.)WALLACE: This week you said that Black Lives Matter and the Confederate flag are both matters, issues of freedom of speech.TRUMP: Yeah.WALLACE: But in the case of the Confederate flag, there are a lot of people who say these were traitors who split from this country, fought this country in large part to preserve slavery. Is the Confederate flag offensiveTRUMP: It depends on who you’re talking about, when you’re talking about.TRUMP: When people – when people proudly have their Confederate flags, they’re not talking about racism. They love their flag, it represents the south, they like the south. People right now like the south. I’d say it’s freedom of, of, of many things, but it’s freedom of speech.WALLACE: So you’re not offended by it?TRUMP: Well, I’m not offended either by Black Lives Matter. That’s freedom of speech. And you know, the whole thing with cancel culture, we can’t cancel our whole history. We can’t forget that the north and the south fought. We have to remember that, otherwise we’ll end up fighting again. You can’t just cancel all...WALLACE: But let me ask you this when it gets to be more than just cancel – well, maybe this is cancel culture. The National Defense Authorization Act, the NDAA, you have threatened to veto it because in the bill, and this was supported by Republicans as well as Democrats, it would rename army bases named for Confederate generals. Now this is a bill that funds military operations, it gives soldiers a pay raise.TRUMP: Yeah.WALLACE: You’re going to veto that?TRUMP: No, because they’ll get their pay raise. Hey, look, don’t tell me this. I got soldiers the biggest pay raises in the history of our military.WALLACE: Understood.TRUMP: I got soldiers brand new equipment, brand new jets, brand new rockets, brand new – $2.5 trillion. I did more for the military than any president that’s ever had this office.WALLACE: But you’re going to veto this bill?TRUMP: Because I think that Fort Bragg, Fort Robert E. Lee, all of these forts that have been named that way for a long time, decades and decades…WALLACE: But the military says they’re for this.TRUMP: …excuse me, excuse me. I don’t care what the military says. I do – I’m supposed to make the decision. Fort Bragg is a big deal. We won two World Wars, nobody even knows General Bragg. We won two World Wars. Go to that community where Fort Bragg is, in a great state, I love that state, go to the community, say how do you like the idea of renaming Fort Bragg, and then what are we going to name itWe’re going to name it after the Reverend Al Sharpton? What are you going to name it, Chris, tell me what you’re going to name it? So there’s a whole thing here. We won two World Wars, two World Wars, beautiful World Wars that were vicious and horrible, and we won them out of Fort Bragg, we won out of all of these forts that now they want to throw those names away.And, no, I’m against that, and you know what, most other people are. And I even – I don’t believe in polls because I see the fakest polls I’ve ever seen, but that poll is a 64 percent thing, which actually surprised me. We won World Wars out of these military bases. No, I’m not going to go changing them, I’m not going to go changing them.WALLACE: So you’ll veto them?TRUMP: I might. Yeah, I might.WALLACE: At Mt. Rushmore on July 3rd, you said that we face a far-left fascism in this country and then you said this.TAPE: July 3, 2020TRUMP: Our children are taught in school to hate their own country and to believe that the men and women who built it we’re not heroes, but that were villains.WALLACE: You said our children are taught in school to hate our country. Where do you see that?TRUMP: I just look at – I look at school. I watch, I read, look at the stuff. Now they want to change -- 1492, Columbus discovered America. You know, we grew up, you grew up, we all did, that’s what we learned. Now they want to make it the 1619 project. Where did that come from? What does it represent? I don’t even know, so.WALLACE: It’s slavery.TRUMP: That’s what they’re saying, but they don’t even know. They just want to make a change. Cancel culture – I hate the term, actually, but I use itWALLACE: But are they teaching people to hate America?TRUMP: Oh, I think so yeah, I think so. Look at the professors. Look at what’s going on in the colleges. If a conservative goes on a college – and look, we have as many as them. Excuse me, I think to the best of my knowledge, we’re sitting at the White House and the Oval Office is right behind me. We have as many as them.WALLACE: Who’s them?TRUMP: The liberal radical left, and I’m not talking all – I think liberal, I could tell you I like a lot of liberal people. I like a lot of liberal governors and senators, but, but Chris, we have a radical left destructive ideology and it’s being taught in our schools.And don’t act like you’re surprised to hear this – there are books written about it, and we can’t let that go on. We can’t let them change the true meaning of what we’re all about and that’s what they’re trying to do and I don’t want it to happen. Not on my watch. It’s not going to happen on my watch.WALLACE:\xa0 Mr. President, you\'ll be happy to know that Fox News has a new poll out today and you\'re going to be the very first person to hear about it. In the national horse race, Joe Biden leads you by 8 points, 49 percent to 41.\xa0 That\'s 3, 4 points slimmer than it was a month ago. And on the issues, people trust Biden more to handle the coronavirus by 17 points, on race relations by 21 points, and even on the economy they trust Biden more by 1 point. I understand you still have more than a hundred days to this election, but at this point you\'re losing.TRUMP:\xa0 First of all, I\'m not losing, because those are fake polls. They were fake in 2016 and now they\'re even more fake. The polls were much worse in 2016. They interviewed 22 percent Republicans. Well, how do you do 22 percent Republican? You see what\'s going on. I have other polls that put me leading, and we have polls where I\'m leading. I have a poll where we\'re leading in every swing state.\xa0 And I don\'t believe that your -- first of all, the Fox polls, whoever does your Fox polls, they\'re among the worst. They got it all wrong in 2016. They\'ve been wrong on every poll I\'ve ever seen.WALLACE:\xa0 I -- I must tell you...TRUMP:\xa0 No, I\'m just telling you. And let me ask you this, so on the economy -- so I\'ve always led on the economy by a lot.WALLACE:\xa0 I know, which is why I was surprised by this number.TRUMP:\xa0 Biden can\'t put two sentences together. They wheel him out. He goes up -- he repeats -- they ask him questions. He reads a teleprompter and then he goes back into his basement. You tell me the American people want to have that in an age where we\'re in trouble with other nations that are looking to do numbers on us.WALLACE:\xa0 So let me ask you a direct question.TRUMP:\xa0 No, no...WALLACE:\xa0 No, I\'m going to ask you a direct question about Joe Biden. Is Joe Biden senile?TRUMP:\xa0 I don\'t want to say that. I\'d say he\'s not competent to be president. To be president, you have to be sharp and tough and so many other things. He doesn\'t even come out of his basement. They think, ""Oh this is a great campaign."" So he goes in, I\'ll then make a speech, it\'ll be a great speech, and some young guy, starts writing, ""Vice President Biden said this, this, this, this."" He didn\'t say it. Joe doesn\'t know he\'s alive, OK? He doesn\'t know he\'s alive. Do the American people want that, number one. Number two, I built the greatest economy ever built anywhere in the world; not only of this country, anywhere in the world.\xa0 Until we got hit with the China virus. We got hit with the virus, shouldn\'t have happened, and we had to close up, we saved millions of lives. Now we\'ve opened it up, got to go back to school. We\'re open. We\'ve got to do things. We had the best job numbers we\'ve ever had last month. We should have good ones coming up in two weeks. Look, I built the greatest economy in history, I\'m now doing it again. You see the numbers; the numbers are through the roof. The Democrats are purposely keeping their schools closed, keeping their states closed. I called Michigan, I want to have a big rally in Michigan. Do you know we\'re not allowed to have a rally in Michigan? Do you know we\'re not allowed to have a rally in Minnesota? Do you know we\'re not allowed to have a rally in Nevada? We\'re not allowed to have rallies.WALLACE: Well, some people would say it’s a health...TRUMP:\xa0 In these Democrat-run states...WALLACE:\xa0 But, wait a minute, some people would that it\'s a health risk, sir.TRUMP: Some people would say fineWALLACE:\xa0 I mean we had some issues after Tulsa.TRUMP:\xa0 But I would guarantee if everything was gone 100 percent, they still wouldn\'t allow it. They\'re not allowing me to do it. So they\'re not -- they\'re not allowing me to have rallies.WALLACE:\xa0 But I\'ve got to tell you, if I may, sir, respectfully, in the Fox poll, they asked people, who is more competent? Who\'s got -- whose mind is sounder? Biden beats you in that.TRUMP:\xa0 Well, I\'ll tell you what, let\'s take a test.\xa0 Let\'s take a test right now. Let\'s go down, Joe and I will take a test. Let him take the same test that I took.WALLACE:\xa0 Incidentally, I took the test too when I heard that you passed it.TRUMP:\xa0 Yeah, how did you do?WALLACE:\xa0 It\'s not – well it\'s not that hardest test. They have a picture and it says “what’s that” and it’s an elephant.TRUMP:\xa0 No no no...TRUMP:\xa0 You see, that\'s all misrepresentation.WALLACE:\xa0 Well, that\'s what it was on the web.TRUMP:\xa0 It\'s all misrepresentation. Because, yes, the first few questions are easy, but I\'ll bet you couldn\'t even answer the last five questions. I\'ll bet you couldn\'t, they get very hard, the last five questions.WALLACE:\xa0 Well, one of them was count back from 100 by seven.TRUMP:\xa0 Let me tell you...WALLACE:\xa0 Ninety-three.TRUMP:\xa0... you couldn\'t answer -- you couldn\'t answer many of the questions.WALLACE:\xa0 Ok, what\'s the question?TRUMP:\xa0 I\'ll get you the test, I\'d like to give it. I\'ll guarantee you that Joe Biden could not answer those questions.WALLACE:\xa0 OK.TRUMP:\xa0 OK. And I answered all 35 questions correctly.WALLACE:\xa0 You -- you talk about how you\'re winning, campaigns going well. Why did you replace Brad Parscale?TRUMP:\xa0 Because he\'s a great digital guy, we all like him a lot, but I have somebody that was involved – you know they were all on the 2016 campaign. We have Corey and we have all the people. And actually, Steve Bannon\'s been much better not being involved. He says the greatest president ever. I mean, he\'s saying things that I said, ""Let\'s keep Steve out there, he\'s doing a good job."" But they\'re all being -- they\'re all involved. If Joe Biden got in, first of all, he won\'t call the shots. The people -- the radical left people that\'s around him will call. Religion will be gone, OK? Life, you could forget about that, the whole question of life. Supreme Court...WALLACE:\xa0 When you say life, you mean abortion?TRUMP:\xa0 Absolutely. 100 percent. That whole question, which is a very -- you know, it\'s always been a 50-50 thing.WALLACE:\xa0 I understand.TRUMP:\xa0 It\'s actually trending a little bit more towards one side now.WALLACE:\xa0 When you say religion is going to be gone, what does that mean?TRUMP:\xa0 Well, look at what they\'re doing to the churches. They won\'t let the churches even open if they want to stand in a field six feet apart. We\'ve had churches that wanted to stand in fields six feet apart.\xa0 There has never been an administration that\'s done so much as I have, from tax cuts to regulation cuts to rebuilding the military to getting choice for the vets. Nobody\'s done the things I\'ve done. Nobody. In three and a half years no other president\'s been able to do what I\'ve done.WALLACE: You\'re running in large part on the economy. You\'ve built it once. Now we had the coronavirus. You\'re going to build it again. And in fact you had great jobs numbers in May, you had solid jobs numbers in June.\xa0But I want you to look at some projections. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the unemployment rate at the end of the year will be 10.5 percent. JPMorgan says in the fourth quarter GDP will contract by 6.2 percent. With states now rolling back some of the reopening and...TRUMP:\xa0 On purpose.WALLACE:\xa0 Well, there are a lot of Republican...TRUMP:\xa0 On purpose.WALLACE:\xa0 Well, there are a lot of Republican states, like Texas...TRUMP:\xa0 There is no reason...WALLACE:\xa0 And here\'s...TRUMP:\xa0 They\'ll be open very soon.WALLACE:\xa0 Let me just ask my question.TRUMP:\xa0 There\'s no reason for California to be doing what they\'re doing.WALLACE:\xa0Alright.TRUMP:\xa0 Except for November 3rd.WALLACE:\xa0 With the states shutting back their reopening, in a lot of cases new lockdowns, won\'t the economy still be a problem for you on Election Day?TRUMP:\xa0 I don\'t think so. I think the economy is expanding and growing beautifully.\xa0 Now, the Democrats want to keep it closed as long as possible because they think that\'s good for elections. But I think the economy is doing very well. Now we\'re coming back and we\'re coming back at a level that nobody would have thought possible. And we are -- and by the way, take a look at another, I mean, a gauge, whether you like it or not, the stock market. The stock market, NASDAQ hit its all-time high two weeks ago and has beaten it 14 different times, ok?\xa0 The stock market, Dow, et cetera, is a thousand points away from its all-time high, meaning very close. We\'re gonna have a stock market perhaps on November 3rd that’s the highest in history.WALLACE: I want to talk to you about Obamacare. Since the pandemic hit, millions of people have lost their jobs and thereby lost their health insurance, and almost a half a million have signed up for Obamacare. Your administration just announced that you\'re signing onto a lawsuit to overturn Obamacare.TRUMP:\xa0 And replace it.WALLACE:\xa0Why does it make sense to overturn Obamacare which people now are relying on? Democrats are going to say, ""The man who wanted to kill Obamacare is going to take away your -- the protection for pre-existing conditions.""TRUMP:\xa0 First of all, we got rid of the individual mandate.WALLACE:\xa0 I understand.TRUMP:\xa0 Pre-existing conditions will always be taken care of by me and Republicans, 100 percent.WALLACE:\xa0 But you\'ve been in office three and a half years, you don\'t have a plan.TRUMP:\xa0 Well, we haven\'t had. Excuse me. You heard me yesterday. We\'re signing a health care plan within two weeks, a full and complete health care plan that the Supreme Court decision on DACA gave me the right to do. So we\'re going to solve -- we\'re going to sign an immigration plan, a health care plan, and various other plans. And nobody will have done what I\'m doing in the next four weeks. The Supreme Court gave the president of the United States powers that nobody thought the president had, by approving, by doing what they did -- their decision on DACA. And DACA\'s going to be taken care of also. But we\'re getting rid of it because we\'re going to replace it with something much better. What we got rid of already, which was most of Obamacare, the individual mandate. And that I\'ve already won on. And we won also on the Supreme Court. But the decision by the Supreme Court on DACA allows me to do things on immigration, on health care, on other things that we\'ve never done before. And you\'re going to find it to be a very exciting two weeks.WALLACE: Your niece, Mary Trump, has written a book about you and your family. And one of her main points is that she says your dad, Fred Trump, Sr., damaged the whole family and here’s what she says about what you learned from your father--TAPE:ABC News/GMA July 16, 2020MARY TRUMP: He learned to become the killer you mentioned. Um the man who needs to succeed at all costs, who will do anything um to get attention, financial rewards, and to win.WALLACE: Do you see any truth in that?TRUMP: My father liked to win. My father was a very good man. He was a strong man. It’s disgraceful that she said that. She was not exactly a family favorite. We didn’t have a lot of respect or like for her. I would’ve never said that except she writes a book that’s so stupid and so vicious and it’s a lie. My father was a great, wonderful man.WALLACE: Let me just ask you this question—TRUMP: This is not a person that I spent very much time with, very little time, and now I’m glad.WALLACE: You’ve developed a pretty thick skin over the years from decades of attacks in New York tabloids, now from the press here –TRUMP: Yes.WALLACE: – and your political opponents here in Washington. But even for Donald Trump, does it hurt you at all to be attacked in such personal terms?TRUMP: YeahWALLACE: By a member of your own family?TRUMP: It hurts me more about attacking my father, not being kind to my mother. I have a mother who was like a saint. She was incredible. She was an incredible woman. And she was nasty even to my mother. She’s a very scarred person. She was not much of a family person.But look, let me just tell you, my father was – I think he was the most solid person I’ve ever met. And he was a very good person. He was a very, very good person. He was strong but he was good. For her to say the kind of things, a psychopath, that he was a psychopath, anybody that knew Fred Trump would call him a psychopath?And you know what, if he was I would tell you. And I would say, you know Chris, I was with my father and it was imposs– my father was – he was tough, he was tough on me, he was tough on all of the kids. But tough in a--in a solid sense, in a really good sense. For her to say – I think the word she used was psychopath – what a disgrace. She ought to be ashamed of herself. That book is a lie.WALLACE: Some people were surprised when you agreed to this interview, to sit down with me.TRUMP: What are you going to ask?WALLACE: Especially because of some of the mean tweets that you’ve said about me. Mike Wallace wannabe. Nasty and obnoxious. I will tell you after that one my son, Peter, who you’ve met, called and he said nasty, no, obnoxious, maybe.(LAUGHTER)WALLACE: But here’s the question, one of your beefs seems to be that I put Democrats on the show and I ask them questions. And I guess the question I have is, don’t you understand it’s my job to put Democrats on as well as Republicans? And to ask them probing questions just like I ask Republicans?TRUMP: I’m not a big fan of “Fox,” I’ll be honest with you. They’ve changed a lot since Roger Ailes. And I watch people like Swalwell, who I don’t even know, he goes on the show, he got less than 1 percent, all of a sudden he’s on – being interviewed for endless hours –WALLACE: Yes, but I –TRUMP: Not only him—WALLACE: I interviewed Nancy--TRUMP: I watched the nastiest people –WALLACE: I interviewed, you sent one tweet after I interviewed Nancy Pelosi. And in the interview I asked her specifically about the fact in February you were in Chinatown pitching tourism while the virus was spreading.TAPE: Fox News Sunday April 19, 2020WALLACE: If the President underplayed the threat in the early days, Speaker Pelosi, didn’t you as well?WALLACE: Isn’t that legitimate toTRUMP: I would just say that--WALLACE: --talk to the Speaker of the House?TRUMP: I would just say that – look, I know you very well, I respect you a lot, I respect your father a lot. I thought he was one of the most talented journalists there are. And you likewise are a very talented person. I do think this, I think you are a very – I think you are toward the Democrat side, which is OK. I mean –WALLACE: It’s not true—It– watch the James Comey interview I did in December.TAPE: Fox News Sunday December 15, 2019WALLACE: Seventeen significant errors in the FISA process and you say it was handled in a thoughtful and appropriate way?COMEY: Yeah, he’s right I was wrong.WALLACE: But you make it sound like you’re a bystander- an eye witness- you were the director of the FBI while a lot of this was going on, sir.COMEY: Sure, I’m responsible for that. That’s why I’m telling you I was wrong. I was over confident as director in our procedures.WALLACE: You couldn’t do as tough an interview with Comey.TRUMP: OK.WALLACE: I’d like to think I treat everybody the same.TRUMP: It just seems to me that you are very prone to be nice to the Democrats and maybe I’m wrong about that, Chris, but it’s an honor to be with you it’s fine, I love it. I love that it’s close to 100 degrees out today –WALLACE: Your choice again.TRUMP: Yes, I know.WALLACE: I’m not saying you’re going to lose. I am not saying that. We saw how you turned it around last time.TRUMP: I don’t think I’m going to lose at all.WALLACE: But if you did, how crushing would it be?TRUMP: First of all, let me just tell you something, I know everyone wants to know that because they’d love to see me lose, finally.WALLACE: I’m not – I am not saying that –TRUMP: You know how many times I have been written off? Do you know how many times I’ve been written off?WALLACE: I’ve done some of it myself, Sir.TRUMP: My whole life –WALLACE: I’m not doing it this time.TRUMP: Don’t do it because –WALLACE: But how crushing would it be?TRUMP: And you know why I won’t lose, because the country in the end, they’re not going to have a man who – who’s shot. He’s shot, he’s mentally shot. Let him come out of his basement, go around, I’ll make four or five speeches a day, I’ll be interviewed by you, I’ll be interviewed by the worst killers that hate my – my guts. They hate my guts. There’s nothing they can ask me that I won’t give them a proper answer to. Some people will like it, some people won’t like it.WALLACE: I agree with that.TRUMP: But look –WALLACE: You answer the questions.TRUMP: Let Biden sit through an interview like this, he’ll be on the ground crying for mommy. He’ll say mommy, mommy, please take me home.WALLACE: Well we’ve asked him for an interview, sir.TRUMP: He can’t do an interview. He’s incompetent.There’s a number you don’t mention. It’s called the enthusiasm number. The enthusiasm for Trump is through the roof even higher –WALLACE: I have mentioned it.TRUMP: – even higher than last time. The enthusiasm for Biden is nonexistent. Everyone knows he’s shot.WALLACE: But the enthusiasm against you is high.TRUMP: Well that’s OK. That’s his only shot.WALLACE: Right.TRUMP: And that’s his only shot. I agree. And those people know I’m doing a good job, but there’s something in my personality that they don’t like because look, nobody’s done what I’ve done.Biden wants to come in and ruin our country, triple your taxes. He wants to do things – he wants to add regulations that I\'ve all cut. And we still have regulation – a lot of regulation, but I’ve cut it down to a level that nobody’s – nobody ever thought possible.He will destroy this country, but it won’t be him. It will be the radical left. The same type ideology that took over Venezuela, one of the richest countries in the world. They now have no water, they have no food, and they have no medicine.WALLACE: Two--TRUMP: That’s going to happen here--WALLACE: Two final questions—TRUMP: If he wins--WALLACE: In general, not talking about November, are you a good loser?TRUMP: I’m not a good loser. I don’t like to lose. I don’t lose too often. I don’t like to lose.WALLACE: But are you gracious?TRUMP: You don’t know until you see. It depends. I think mail-in voting is going to rig the election. I really do.WALLACE: Are you suggesting that you might not accept the results of the election?TRUMP: No. I have to see. Look, Hillary Clinton asked me the same thing.WALLACE: No, I asked you the same thing at the debate.TAPE: Presidential Debate, October 19, 2016WALLACE: There is a tradition in this country -- in fact, one of the prides of this country -- is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner. Not saying that you\'re necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country.

I have done more than any president in history in the first three and a half years, and I’ve done it suffering through investigations where people have been – General Flynn, where people have been so unfairly treated.The Russia hoax, it was all a hoax. The Mueller scam, it was all scam. It was all false. I made a bad decision on – one bad decision. Jeff Sessions, and now I feel good because he lost overwhelmingly in the great state of Alabama.Here’s the bottom line. I’ve been very unfairly treated, and I don’t say that as paranoid. I\'ve been very – everybody says it. It’s going to be interesting to see what happens. But there was tremendous evidence right now as to how unfairly treated I was. President Obama and Biden spied on my campaign. It’s never happened in history. If it were the other way around, the people would be in jail for 50 years right now.That would be Comey, that would be Brennan, that would be all of this – the two lovers, Strzok and Page, they would be in jail now for many, many years. They would be in jail, it would’ve started two years ago and they’d be there for 50 years. The fact is, they illegally spied on my campaign. Let’s see what happens.

But on Thursday, without using Trump’s name, the president accused him of inciting the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 in hopes of disrupting congressional certification of Biden’s Electoral College victory in the 2020 election.2021, THE YEAR THAT THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RACE IGNITED""We must be absolutely clear about what is true and what is a lie.

', ' close  Video Trump began to fear his own base: Kinzinger Rep. Adam Kinzinger criticizes Trump and reasserts the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election on ‘Your World.’Illinois congressman Adam Kinzinger, one of the only Republicans on the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2020 attack on the Capitol, told Fox News he has no regrets about becoming a GOP ""pariah"" and promised that the panel would find out the truth behind the riots that happened a year ago.Kinzinger and Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney are the only two GOP members on the January 6 committee. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled his entire slate of members after Speaker Nancy Pelosi denied the admittance to Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and James Banks of Indiana.The panel is chaired by Mississippi Democrat Bennie Thompson and features a number of vocal anti-Trump Democrats, including Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Adam Schiff of California.Kinzinger, who represents a Joliet-area district, told Fox News Thursday he is disappointed in his former ""friend"" McCarthy for ""denying cover"" to Republicans like himself that wished to go against former President Trump in the wake of the attack.""It pains me because Kevin and I used to be friends,"" he said on ""Your World."" ""On January 1, I was on a conference call with Kevin. I said ‘Kevin, I fear there’s going to be violence on the 6th because when you convince people an election is stolen, if you believe that, violence is a logical outcome from that.\'  \n      House 1/6 Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi is shown.\n      ""[McCarthy] just said, ‘Operator, next caller’ … Since January 6, he gave that speech saying Trump bears responsibility. Two weeks later he was at Mar-a-Lago. In that intervening time, there was a lot of silence in the Republican ranks about where are we going to go … The second he went there, he basically denied top cover to anybody that wanted to step out and say the truth and really brought the former president’s political fortunes back to life.""Kinzinger went on to criticize Trump for what he characterized as creating an environment in which the conservative Republican base reflexively defends the former president and creates fear in politicians who are always looking ahead two or six years to their next election.""As leaders, we need our base to elect us… part of that two-way street is that we have to lead people as well,"" he said. ""It is a responsibility, it’s a unique responsibility. I think too many people became fearful. We have a two-year election cycle, so you’re always in one. They became fearful of losing. They became fearful of losing that job.""""You can convince yourself I’ll stay quiet so [that] I survive because somebody may be with much more conspiracy-driven attitudes will replace me. The problem is now is the time to stand up and tell the people that we represent the truth.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)\n      (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)When asked whether Trump caused the Capitol riot, Kinzinger replied that he did not want to ""go out on a limb and say that"" specifically.""That is information we want to get to,"" he said. ""What we know is that for 180-some minutes, he watched television and watched the attack unfold. I can tell you at a basic level that is abdicating your oath of office to ‘defend the Constitution against enemies, foreign & domestic’.""""Now, if he was gleeful – and did he know stuff leading up to January 6, that’s what I can’t answer,"" Kinzinger continued. ""That’s what we hope to be able to answer. I think that will show the difference between an incompetent, or a president frozen in inaction versus a president that knew what was coming. That will be key. We don’t have that yet. We’ll get there.""One year ago, Trump remarked during a speech that his supporters will ""soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard."" Various critics point to the chronological gap between the Capitol being breached and the president making any public overtures to try to halt it after he had returned to the White House.Earlier Thursday, Trump – who has been banished from multiple social media platforms – put out a statement condemning President Biden\'s address on the one year since the Capitol riots and singled out the Jan. 6 committee, calling panelists the ""Unselect Committee"" and claiming critics want to use the anniversary to ""stoke fears and divide America.""On ""Your World"", Kinzinger said he and Thompson are receiving good cooperation, however, from some individuals, including those who worked with former Vice President Mike Pence.  \n      House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., responds to reporters at the Capitol in Washington, Friday, Dec. 3, 2021, about the behavior of Rep.

Significantly the vice president’s former team has been quite cooperative and shedding light on what we need to know,"" he said.""I’m interested in what led to January 6. What were the circumstances? What did [Trump] know prior to January 6? Because what is most important, even more than accountability for that day, is that we don’t have anything like that happen again.""Some of the committee\'s actions to compel testimony, however, have been rocky.Stephen Bannon, a former Trump adviser and ex-editor of Breitbart News, told reporters late last year that Kinzinger\'s panel\'s vote to hold him in contempt will become ""the misdemeanor from hell"" for them and for Attorney General Merrick Garland.""We\'re going to go on the offense. We are tired of playing defense,"" said Bannon.Host Neil Cavuto also asked Kinzinger\'s thoughts on Trump potentially ""pulling a Grover Cleveland"" and defeating Biden – who would essentially play the role of President Benjamin Harrison – to serve two non-consecutive terms if he ran in the 2024 presidential race. The congressman said he certainly would not support Trump if he ran again.  \n      A portrait of U.S. President Grover Cleveland, who served from 1885-1889 and 1893-1897. \xa0REUTERS/Library of Congress/Handout \xa0 \xa0 (UNITED STATES). \xa0FOR EDITORIAL USE ONLY.\xa0\n      ""As a conservative, policy-wise, those are the things that excite me – getting conservative policies.

Every day it’s a new fight: Trying to unify a country when we’re facing real enemies like China, we\'re facing Russia on the border with Ukraine, Iran with a nuclear program, and we\'re more interested in fighting the other political party than actually defending American interests. It only gets worse.""Kinzinger concluded by saying he is proud to stand with Liz Cheney as outliers in the Republican caucus. Cheney and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, were the only other Republicans on hand in the House chamber during commemoration speeches earlier Thursday.""That\'s fine,"" said Kinzinger.

But this seemed more in line with the flirtations of every potential candidate: keeping the options open, not ruling it out, as a way of staying relevant and drawing media coverage.The conventional wisdom has been that the former president would raise a ton of money, help MAGA candidates defeat non-Trumpy Republicans in the primaries, take credit for GOP gains in the midterms, and then jump into the race.FROM JOE ROGAN TO MIKE FLYNN, THE RISE IN BASHING — AND BANNING — IDEOLOGICAL OPPONENTSBut since when has Trump been conventional about anything?Given his stolen-election claims that still play to the faithful, Trump is obviously hungering for a rematch. But I’m not sure I see the advantages of making it official now. Declaring for president 3-1/2 years before the election might help him with fundraising, but he’s already taking in truckloads of cash. Candidate status could spur the media into covering him more, but he knows how to make news now, even without the Twitter and Facebook megaphone.\xa0Trump is obviously hungering for a rematch. Besides, the press doesn’t need much prodding to focus on Trump, a box-office draw even for the news outlets that can’t stand him. It’s no secret that major media organizations have seen their ratings and traffic plummet in the Biden era.  \n      Could President Biden face a rematch with Donald Trump in 2024?\n      Either way, Trump wins. If this is just saber-rattling, he gets coverage. If it’s serious, he gets even more coverage. And Trump knows the value of the guessing game, having teased possible White House runs for decades before taking the plunge in 2016. He did it with me back in 1987, when he was publicizing ""The Art of the Deal.""Smoke signalThe latest smoke signal came from reporter Lauren Windsor at the Undercurrent, who quoted Jim Jordan as saying Trump would get in ""any day now."" A spokesman for the Republican congressman flatly denied it. But then a cell phone video surfaced late last week of Jordan saying pretty much that (though not the exact quote reported by Windsor).\xa0Trump knows the value of the guessing game, having teased possible White House runs for decades before taking the plunge in 2016.\xa0 ""I talked to him yesterday. He\'s about ready to announce after all of this craziness in Afghanistan,"" Jordan is seen saying.\xa0Longtime Trump adviser Jason Miller, in an interview with Cheddar, put the chances of Trump running against ""somewhere between 99 and 100 percent. I think he is definitely running in 2024,"" Miller said a day after speaking with his ex-boss. ""He has not said the magical words to me, but if you talk to him for a few minutes it’s pretty clear that he’s running.""SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE\'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY\'S HOTTEST STORIESNow Miller is a pro who wouldn’t go rogue on something like that, so the former guy wants this out there — for whatever reason.‘Biden is on the ropes’Politico dives in with a report on Trump building what an unnamed associate describes as a ""turnkey operation,"" which can be activated as soon as he decided to get in the race. It isn’t much — a couple of hires in Iowa, intensified fundraising and online advertising, more interviews, and press statements — but it adds to the sense that this is happening. (So far, at least, the interviews are mainly with Fox opinion hosts, Newsmax and OAN.)SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE\'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY\'S HOTTEST STORIESRep. Matt Gaetz is quoted as saying that ""Trump sees Biden is on the ropes. He wants to throw punches as a combatant, not a heckler from the stands."" Yet the Florida congressman contradicts the any-day-now thesis by saying Trump is in no rush to announce.No candidate has ever needed the traditional infrastructure less than Trump if he tries to become only the second president, after Grover Cleveland, to regain the office he had occupied.

Adam Kinzinger of Illinois on Friday announced that he wouldn’t run for reelection next year.The six-term conservative congressman and combat pilot veteran made headlines in January as the second-most high profile of the 10 House Republicans to vote to impeach former President Donald Trump. He becomes the second of that group to not seek another two-year term in the House in the 2022 midterm elections, following Rep. Anthony Gonzales of Ohio.As he fights to break the GOP from its current domination by the former president and works to back other anti-Trump Republicans, Kinzinger stressed in a video announcing his decision that it has ""become increasingly obvious to me that in order to break the narrative, I cannot focus on both a reelection to Congress and a broader fight nationwide.""WHO IS ADAM KINZINGER: THE CONSERVATIVE CONGRESSMAN TURNED ANTI-TRUMP GOP LEADER""I want to make it clear, this isn’t the end of my political future but the beginning,"" he also emphasized. ""Let me be clear, my passion for this country has only grown. My desire to make a difference is bigger than it’s ever been.""Kinzinger joined the Air Force after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, serving in both the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He’s currently a lieutenant colonel in the Air National Guard.\xa0As a 32-year-old, he was elected to Congress in the Tea Party wave election of 2010, beating a Democratic incumbent by nearly 15 points in a north-central and northeastern Illinois district, thanks in part to Sarah Palin’s endorsement. Two years later, after redistricting, he took down 10-term GOP Rep. Don Manzullo in the primary before winning the general election.In early January, Kinzinger joined nine other House Republicans to impeach Trump\xa0for his role in inciting the deadly attack on the Capitol by right-wing extremists and other Trump supporters bent on disrupting congressional certification of Joe Biden’s Electoral College victory. The storming of the Capitol occurred soon after Trump urged a large crowd of supporters he addressed at a rally near the White House to march to the Capitol and show strength in protesting the certification of the\xa0election.Trump was impeached by the House a week later on one count of inciting an insurrection. The 10 Republicans joined all 222 Democrats in voting to impeach Trump, with 197 Republicans voting against impeachment. In February, after leaving the White House, Trump was acquitted in a Senate trial, with seven GOP senators joining all 50 Democrats in the chamber to vote to convict the former president.PELOSI TAPS KINZINGER TO SERVE AS SECOND REPUBLICAN ON JAN. 6 INVESTIGATION PANELAll 10 House Republicans instantly faced the wrath of Trump and his allies, who have worked to defeat the lawmakers as they run for reelection in the midterms. Trump’s endorsed primary challengers to a number of the 10, including the most well known of the bunch, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming.""I stand in awe of the courage of the other nine members in the House who voted to impeach a president of their own party, knowing it could be detrimental to their political career,"" Kinzinger said.Trump, in a statement after Kinzinger\'s announcement, wrote ""2 down, 8 to go!""In an apparent jab at the former president’s brand of divisive politics, Kinzinger lamented that ""our political parties only survive by appealing to the most motivated and the most extreme elements within it. And the price tag to power has skyrocketed and fear and distrust has served as an effective strategy to meet that cost.""And he argued that ""dehumanizing each other has become the norm. We’ve taken it from social media to the streets. We’ve allowed leaders to reach power selling the false premise that strength comes from degrading others and dehumanizing those that look, act, think differently that we do. As a country, we’ve fallen for those lies and now we face a poisoned country.""KINZINGER HAULS IN BIG BUCKS AFTER FACING TRUMP\'S WRATH OVER IMPEACHMENTKinzinger, who along with Cheney are the only two Republicans on a Democratic- named special committee investigating the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, has seen his \xa0stance against Trump dramatically boost his fundraising. And the Country First Leadership PAC, which he formed earlier this year to support other anti-Trump Republicans, is also hauling in big bucks.The congressman said that ""I know I’m not alone. There’s many Americans that are desperately searching for a better way. They want solutions, not more problems.""""Now is the time for choosing,"" he urged. ""Now is the time to join our movement at Country First.""Another likely factor in his decision to not seek another term in the House is redistricting.With Illinois losing a congressional seat due to the 2020 Census and Democrats controlling the redistricting process in the blue state, according to maps awaiting the signature of the Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Kinzinger may have been dumped into the same district as Republican Rep.

Many courts have upheld that this kind of action can only come from the Legislative Branch.\xa0FLASHBACK: RON KLAIN SAID IN 2020 THAT BIDEN WOULD USE HIS ‘POWER’ TO REVERSE COVID-19 TESTING SHORTAGES  \n      A police officer maintains a watch during a demonstration by victims of gun violence in front of the Supreme Court as arguments begin in a major case on gun rights on Nov. 3, 2021 in Washington, D.C. \xa0(Photo by Joshua Roberts/Getty Images)\n      (Joshua Roberts)This week, the case will be argued in front of the Supreme Court—an important step to finally put these mandates behind us.\xa0I hear from constituents every day who are terrified of the consequences of this mandate. Business owners despise the government reaching even further into their operations; workers are stressed over the choice between their freedom and their careers—something no one in this country should ever have to face.\xa0Personal medical decisions are between an individual and their doctor. The government does not have the right to make your medical decisions for you, but President Biden doesn’t care about your personal freedoms nor medical autonomy.\xa0 VideoNot only is Biden’s mandate anti-freedom, it’s also anti-business. Employers who do not comply with this executive action—which never went through either chamber of Congress—are faced with fines up to $136,532. These small businesses have already survived brutal pandemic restrictions, many are hanging on by a thread.The option to test weekly as an alternative is also a burden on workers, and unfeasible for two reason: cost and availability. Just over the last few weeks, the meager availability of COVID tests has proven disastrous. Despite the Biden Administration’s promise to mail a test to any family that needs one, millions of Americans are unable to access COVID tests.\xa0The long-term implications of a mandate like this are even more unnerving. If the government can take your medical autonomy away this easily, what’s next?\xa0 VideoVaccination revolutionized medicine. Vaccines ended terrible diseases that plagued humankind for centuries, and they continue to protect us today. However, vaccines are not infallible. They are not an option for everyone, and they should never be forced on someone who doesn’t want them.\xa0The Biden administration’s single-track focus on vaccination rather than therapeutics for COVID is telling. We know that none of the COVID vaccines prevent you from contracting the disease, and they don’t prevent you from passing it on to someone else. Mandating a vaccine for workers that accomplishes neither of those things is not only unconstitutional, but incomprehensible.\xa0Recently, Dr. Anthony Fauci said that even though vaccination would not make air travel any safer, he recommends a vaccine mandate on planes as a method to increase the number of vaccinated individuals.  \n      Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical adviser to the president, meets with the White House COVID-19 Response Team on the latest developments related to the Omicron variant in the South Court Auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House Campus in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 4, 2022.\xa0\n      ((AP Photo/Andrew Harnik))Now, Biden admits what I—and many others—have said all along: the federal government does not have the solution for COVID. This comes after Biden repeatedly promised on the campaign trail that he had a plan to shut down the virus and criticized President Donald Trump for leaving many decisions to local leaders.\xa0CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTEREven after this admission from Biden, he has yet to abandon the vaccine mandates.\xa0The President cannot have it both ways. He cannot absolve himself of responsibility for a solution while mandating vaccination on private employers.

Exactly one year later, Joe Biden took office after campaigning on the promise that he was ""going to shut down the virus.""\xa0Fast-forward to today, as we near the one-year mark of his presidency. It’s clear\xa0that\xa0even though\xa0Biden said he would defeat this virus, it’s COVID that has defeated him. And based on his shocking admission that there is ""no federal solution"" to the pandemic, it looks like he knows it too.\u202f\xa0In his campaign, Biden’s closing message centered on his ability to lead us through and out of this pandemic, yet more than half of Americans now say they disapprove of his handling of the pandemic. \xa0WHY BLUE STATE COVID RESPONSE WILL KEEP PUSHING AMERICANS TO FREER RED STATES IN 2022COVID was considered a bright spot of Biden’s presidency by his cheerleaders in the mainstream media. Now the pandemic belongs on his growing list of failures, including the border crisis, his deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan, supply chain breakdowns, and skyrocketing costs for consumer goods and services.\u202f\xa0 VideoWhere did he go wrong? Joe Biden tried to make the pandemic bend to his politics – picking and choosing when to follow the science and when to follow his far-left, radical liberal base. It’s gross incompetence that is hurting our country, leaving many to wonder if we’re transitioning from a pandemic to an endemic.\xa0We’ve witnessed President Biden’s gross incompetence when developing the testing we need to keep this under control. Biden’s own press secretary scoffed at the idea to send free tests to every American just days before the Biden administration announced a plan to mass mail 500 million at-home tests. Now, many experts, including myself, are worried this effort comes too late.I’m still deeply concerned about President Biden’s refusal to make monoclonal antibodies directly available for states to purchase as needed.\xa0 Meandering bureaucrats slowed our ability to get life-saving therapeutics in the hands of those who needed them, and we still don’t have enough approved.\u202fI have made this argument since the early days of the pandemic. Doctors don’t just prevent disease. We also need tools and strategies to help patients during breakthroughs of disease. We witnessed shockingly slow evaluations of life-saving drugs that existed prior to the emergence of COVID and could have saved thousands of lives.\xa0\xa0Just before Christmas, the FDA approved Pfizer’s Paxlovid, an antiviral pill that is 90% effective in keeping high-risk COVID patients out of the hospital, but the supply available to hospitals is limited, capping the potential benefit of these crucial therapeutics.\u202fPharmacies have no idea when they will receive the drug for outpatient use by desperate COVID-infected customers.\xa0\xa0I’m still deeply concerned about President Biden’s refusal to make monoclonal antibodies directly available for states to purchase as needed. As cases rise, we must use all treatments at our disposal to help save lives – no matter where the cases may occur.\u202f\xa0 VideoWhen it comes to therapeutics, the FDA let its process stand in the way of our patients – but in their handling of vaccines, they are doing the opposite. Recently, reports have circulated that the FDA is bypassing its scientific advisers to authorize boosters for all kids 12-15 next week. This shouldn’t be the case.\u202f\xa0Joe Biden tries to convince us that this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. For months, even his own CDC has said that breakthrough cases among vaccinated people are possible.\u202f\xa0I encourage folks to talk to their doctor and get vaccinated, but the data is clear – vaccinations aren’t enough to defeat this disease.\u202f\xa0 VideoBoosters are the wrong challenge for America to undertake to save lives. We need to treat this disease and focus on adults who need medications, and ensure they have the therapeutics they need. Since when is the failure of a treatment being blamed on those who do not take the treatment?\u202f\xa0I\'m a doctor. My job is to review the data, and what I’ve learned is that one size does not fit all. We should acknowledge natural immunity and do more to help people understand how their cases will impact them as the virus progresses.\u202f\xa0When you have a one-thousandfold difference between the incidence of infection and complications in older people versus young kids, we have to be brave enough as conservatives, as Republicans, and as Americans to talk openly about this before embracing lockdowns and keeping children in school.\u202f\xa0 VideoWe know that remote learning has been detrimental to our children, especially those from lower-income households. The CDC has said so. Even the new Democratic mayor of New York City says he’ll keep schools open because he knows the toll has been devastating on students.

That\'s the trick.At his inauguration, President Joe Biden promised the return of good government and newspapers like the Washington Post heralded the end to Trump\'s ""\xadscandal-plagued single term."" Now, at the end of the first year, readers are being asked to ""think back four years ago: The Trump administration looked more like \'The Godfather\' – without the skill."" VideoThere is ample reason for the White House and many in the media to celebrate the lack of scandals in the Biden administration because it was a collective effort. Of course, four years ago, the media was all-in on the Russian collusion allegations. The media was doing non-stop coverage of the Steele dossier with little scrutiny or effort to uncover those who funded it.\xa0The dossier was later discredited and American intelligence warned that Russian intelligence may have used it to plant disinformation. While the Clinton campaign repeatedly denied funding the dossier, it was revealed (after the election) that not only did the Clinton campaign fund and push the dossier but also allegedly lied to Congress, the media, and the FBI. Clinton campaign chair John Podesta allegedly denied such funding to congressional staff. According to reports, sitting next to him was Clinton attorney Marc Elias (who was later found to have funded the dossier through the Clinton campaign\'s legal account). VideoThe only thing more impressive than the relentless coverage of Trump scandals in 2017 was the relentless avoidance of Biden scandals in 2020. The media did give passing coverage to the host of Biden false claims and stories that range from saying that he was ""arrested trying to see Nelson Mandela"" to his evolving Amtrak claims to reinventing his positions on foreign wars like Afghanistan. There were also federal violations by Biden officials and allegations of improper presidential influence on pending investigations. However, when it came to the truly scandalous, the media was thoroughly uninterested.Consider just three of the Voldemort scandals of 2020, or those scandals which must not be named by the media:The Hunter Biden LaptopThe successful effort to bury the Hunter Biden story is the single greatest political achievement in modern politics, but it took a concerted effort by reporters and columnists in Washington. What was most impressive is that the Biden campaign and family never denied that the laptop was authentic. The laptop details potential criminal acts by Hunter Biden from extensive drug use to hiring prostitutes to alleged financial and tax violations.\xa0It also included his admission that prior files were likely in the hands of foreign intelligence to use for blackmailing him and his father. There is also the ""red flag"" gun controversy involving Hunter Biden. Not only did social media companies black out references to the laptop, but the media has steadfastly continued to refuse to pursue these potential criminal acts. The laptop was seized by the FBI in an ongoing federal investigation into possible tax and financial wrongdoing. VideoBiden Family Influence PeddlingInfluence peddling has long been associated with the Biden family but only sparingly reported, even though both President Biden\'s brothers Frank and James are accused of openly hawking their ties to him. Hunter\'s laptop added evidence of hundreds of emails on transactions by Hunter Biden, his uncle James Biden, and Joe Biden. The emails magnify earlier allegations that the Biden family engaged in open influence peddling when Joe Biden was Vice President with an assortment of foreign figures and countries. Some of those dealings continued into the Biden presidency.\xa0Hunter Biden admits that he was a hopeless drug addict well into his father\'s presidential campaign. However, these foreign figures continued to give Hunter millions and Hunter openly assisted in their meetings with his father and linking up with Administration officials. One of the key figures in these dealings has claimed that he met personally with Joe Biden to discuss the deals.  \n      Hunter Biden, Melissa Cohen and baby Beau Biden walk to Marine One upon departure from the White House, May 22, 2021, in Washington. (AP File Photo/Alex Brandon)\n      These meetings and dinners directly contradict denials from President Biden, who is referred to extensively in emails concerning payments and meetings as ""the Big Guy,"" ""Celtic,"" and other names. President Biden appears to have had bills paid from out of these accounts and his shared card may have been used in some of the most dubious transactions. Some dealings have direct national security implications for the United States. Despite the ongoing federal investigation, there has been no call for a Special Counsel even though President Biden is referenced and potentially implicated in some of these transactions. Nevertheless, Hunter continues to rack in the dough by other means, including art deals that have been denounced as ethically corrupt. VideoThe Ashley Biden DiaryThe latest scandal involves the other first child, Ashley Biden. Like her brother Hunter, Ashley has struggled with addiction and left her diary with some clothes in a house in Delray, Florida. The diary was later sent to Project Veritas, a conservative publication which decided not to run the information. The contents of the diary, however, have been reported on other sites, including allegations against her father involving ""inappropriate"" contacts.\xa0As with the Hunter Biden laptop, the Biden family has not denied the authenticity of the diary or the underlying passages. It also did not sue the other conservative sites for defamation in publishing what they alleged to be passages from the diary. Instead, the family lawyers called upon the Justice Department to get involved the case of a missing diary. The Justice Department\'s response was so overwhelming you would have thought that they were investigating the snatching of Lindbergh\'s baby rather than Ashley\'s diary. \xa0It conducted raids on journalists and the seizure of confidential material around the country. VideoThe media was not interested in the use of the FBI to launch a national investigation into the missing diary. Indeed, the raiding of the home of a conservative publisher was barely noted even though the New York Times could also have been raided on the same grounds as Project Veritas. The Times acquired confidential and presumably stolen legal material from Project Veritas and, unlike Project Veritas, published the presumably stolen information. However, the Biden Justice Department was only interested in cracking down on the acquisition or coverage of the Ashley Biden diary.

IT BEAT HIM. HERE\'S WHAT WE MUST DO NOWA sum greater than what was spent fighting World War II or the Great Depression that somehow, according to Biden officials, has failed to adequately provide for COVID testing and remedies. \xa0 VideoThis has to be the most inept and irresponsible White House in history. Not only are they spending us into a deep, dark hole, but they have failed to make intelligent use of the gargantuan amount of funds set aside to address the pandemic, our country’s most critical problem.\xa0When Republicans refused to go along with the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan (ARP) in March, it was not because they had suddenly become fiscal watchdogs. It was because they were outraged that the gigantic spending plan funneled very little money\xa0to the exact\xa0problems the White House is now scrambling to fix.\xa0\xa0Critics described the Rescue Plan as a grab-bag of progressive programs that had little to do with the pandemic and all to do with paying off Democrat-aligned groups like the teachers unions.\xa0\xa0What happened to the rest of the money approved by Congress?\xa0 The only people being ""rescued"" were Democrat legislators who faced losing their jobs as far-left ideologues like Sen.\xa0Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., took control of their party.\xa0Recently, as Americans waited in hours-long lines for COVID tests, inflation hit 40-year highs, and the White House appeared totally unprepared to deal with the omicron surge, people have demanded to know: where did all the money go?\xa0After all, the country has run short of COVID\xa0tests even though some $79 billion – more than the entire GDP of Kenya –\xa0was allocated to developing and distributing such tests.

Of that total, nearly $70 billion remains unspent. Why can’t the White House use those funds for testing?\xa0 VideoWhat happened to the rest of the money approved by Congress? A whopping $844 billion was sent out as direct relief to Americans – all spent. A further $827 billion was directed to businesses under the Paycheck Protection Program, an effort to keep people employed and small firms afloat.\xa0\xa0\xa0Another budget-busting slice of the pie, $674.3 billion, went to state and local governments. The Rescue Plan included $350 billion, which went to shore up failing (mostly) blue cities and states. The funds were allocated based on an unemployment formula that effectively rewarded local authorities for failing to keep businesses open and workers employed.\xa0\xa0\xa0It turned out that most local authorities did not need the money. Because the economy recovered more quickly than expected, tax revenues came in above estimates. According to the Tax Foundation, ""states have only seen revenue declines of $2 billion, making the state aid component 116 times overall losses.""\xa0Numerous cities and states ended up posting budget surpluses; surely, they could chip in to buy some tests and therapeutics.\xa0 VideoIn an October report on its oversight of relief funds, the GAO noted that Treasury had failed to set up adequate monitoring of the monies doled out to cities and states. What a shock.\xa0One of the biggest recipients of funding in the various COVID relief bills has been our schools. Taxpayers probably assume that the $263 billion allocated to education was meant to prepare schools for reopening as the virus abated or for helping kids who fell behind as their classes went remote. They would be wrong.\xa0There was no language in the Rescue Act, which contained the latest slug of money, that demanded any such planning or indeed any such commitment.\xa0\xa0CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERThe funds were available to be used for any purpose chosen by local authorities; only $60 billion of that $263 billion has been spent.

Reporting is sketchy, but some school districts spent their funds on non-COVID related ventures like new football fields and weight rooms instead of addressing learning loss.

""I\'ve said it many times, and it is no more true or real than when we think about the events of Jan. 6: We are in a battle for the soul of America, a battle that by the grace of God and by the goodness and greatness of this nation, we will win.""So to quote Gandhi, ""What the f--- is that about?""\xa0Seriously, this is kind of a big deal because the president of the United States just said we were in a battle for the soul of America, and that implies a good side and a bad side, right, with two teams. Which means if you\'re watching this show and you like this show, you\'re probably on the bad team.\xa0So he\'s not including you in the ""we."" So who is we? Him and Jill? Him and Kamala? Him and his imaginary friend Walter the talking celery stick? Is it Liz Cheney? If she were any more of a phony Democrat, she\'d get an extra vote in 2020.\xa0But the thing is, it can\'t be all Americans, right? Because then his premise for that speech wouldn\'t make any sense. And the special day of commemoration wouldn\'t be necessary because we\'d all be unified and he\'d be a beloved president and we\'d all be dancing naked in a meadow like Brian Kilmeade and Steve Doocy on ketamine at the Lilith Fair. Those were the days.\xa0So let\'s ask Mr. No Time to Think Himself. Mr. President, you want to clarify your comments on unity?\xa0BIDEN\xa0IMPERSONATION: Look, look, look. I was a little angry yesterday, but I said what I meant, right? I said what I meant, I meant what I said. It was about the soul of this country. Alright. And I\'m telling you, you better get on board, on board the — on board the Soul Train. That\'s right. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. Ding, ding, ding. Ding ding.Nice. It really is amazing.\xa0So if it\'s us versus them, who\'s them? It\'s us, not the Germans or the Japanese, then again, who knows what year or century it is, in that scrambled egg he calls a mind. But he\'s made this claim on a fabricated commemoration targeting his political adversaries, and Democrats were saying it\'s worse than Pearl Harbor and 9/11.\xa0Yes, that might be the worst comparison since the NFL is like slavery. But Joe\'s defined himself against something that doesn\'t even exist. A White supremacist movement. A violent insurrection. None of that is real.\xa0Of course, he also tried to compare himself against Trump. But Trump\'s not even president. He\'s not even running against Joe.\xa0So again, Joe\'s defining himself against a mirage. Why is that? Because his leadership is a mirage, a disaster on four legs. You can\'t get worse than Joe and Kam. So they need to distract by demonizing you. And this, from the administration that brought you, ""Parents complaining about schools are terrorists.""But in that tweet and in that speech yesterday, he wasn\'t talking to us. He was talking about us. And that\'s pretty gross.Maybe I\'m nuts, but did Joe just kind of declare a civil war on a sizable portion of America? Because I can\'t believe he thinks we\'re at war with just one guy like Trump or a freak in a Viking hat.\xa0You just pit one half of the country against the other like he was picking sides for dodgeball game. By the way, you might not even believe this crap, because like his bladder, it\'s not him who\'s in control.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBut there are people in his White House who believe we\'re evil, you and me, because you didn\'t vote for them. Maybe you voted for the other guy, who knows. And now Joe uses Jan. 6 to declare a war over the soul of a country.\xa0So back to that question: Is Joe a strong leader? Well, hard times are supposed to bring out the best in men, but what if the best in one man is long gone? And all you have is a hollowed-out husk open for exploitation from any woke operative?\xa0 VideoBut I guess when you collapse Afghanistan, spike inflation and crime and can\'t control corona, all that\'s left is creating a fake emergency.\xa0It seems like that\'s what we have right now. And when I say we, I mean, we the people, as in all Americans, and we all know that there\'s no battle for the soul of this country.\xa0But the fact that the president says it\'s so should scare the crap out of all of us.\xa0This article is adapted from Greg Gutfeld\'s opening monologue on the January 7, 2022 edition of ""Gutfeld!""

Media Matters reportedly used illegal guns to protect organization’s leaderMedia Matters funder bankrolls pro-Hagel campaignConservative media watchdogs push back on Obama’s Fox News attackDemocratic senator says spending only ‘out of control’ on Fox NewsWhy the mainstream media could care less about Obama’s presidential power grabsThis latest volley from the president is just one in a long line of comments from his White House as part of their campaign to silence any dissent they detect in the press corps.Recently, the White House has kept Fox News off of conference calls dealing with the Benghazi attack, despite Fox News being the only outlet that was regularly reporting on it and despite Fox having top notch foreign policy reporters.They have left Chris Wallace’s ""Fox News Sunday"" out of a round of interviews that included CNN, NBC, ABC and CBS for not being part of a “legitimate” news network. In October 2009, as part of an Obama administration onslaught against Fox News,White House senior adviser David Axelrod said on ABC’s “This Week” that the Fox News Channel is ""not really a news station"" and that much of the programming is ""not really news.""Whether you are liberal or conservative, libertarian, moderate or politically agnostic, everyone should be concerned when leaders of our government believe they can intentionally try to delegitimize a news organization they don’t like.In fact, if you are a liberal – as I am – you should be the most offended, as liberalism is founded on the idea of cherishing dissent and an inviolable right to freedom of expression.That more liberals aren\'t calling out the White House for this outrageous behavior tells you something about the state of liberalism in America today.Sure, everyone understands how some of Fox\'s opinion programming would get under President Obama\'s skin, the same way MSNBC from 4pm until closing time is not the favorite stop for Republicans. \xa0But it\'s not okay -- or presidential -- to continue smearing an entire network of hard working journalists because you are mad at Sean Hannity. During the initial launch of the war on Fox News in October 2009, then-White House Communications Director Anita Dunn told the New York Times of Fox News, “[W]e don’t need to pretend that this is the way that legitimate news organizations behave.” On CNN, she declared that Fox was a “wing of the Republican Party.” Then: “let\'s not pretend they\'re a news network the way CNN is.""Gosh, this sounds so familiar. In fact, it’s exactly the line that Media Matters used in a 2010 memo to donors: “Fox News is not a news organization. It is the de facto leader of the GOP, and it is long past time that it is treated as such by the media, elected officials and the public.”In fact, this is the signature line of Media Matters in discussing Fox News, which they say they exist to destroy. Their CEO, David Brock told Politico in 2011 that their strategy was a “war on Fox” that is executed by 90 staff members and a $10 million yearly budget, gratis liberal donors.Can someone explain to me how it’s “liberal” to try and shut down a media organization? What the Obama administration is doing, and what liberals are funding at MMFA is beyond chilling – it’s a deep freeze.On the heels of Dunn’s attack on Fox, Brock wrote a letter to progressive organizations bragging about the U.S. government trashing a news organization: “In recent days, a new level of scrutiny has been directed toward Fox News, in no small part due to statements from the White House, and from Media Matters, challenging its standing as a news organization.” Point of order: who put Media Matters in charge of determining what is and isn\'t a news operation?A Media Matters memo found its way into the public domain and if you care at all about decency and freedom of the press, it will make you throw up. If you like McCarthyism, it’s right up your alley. It details to liberal donors how they have plans to assemble opposition research on Fox News employees.It complains of the “pervasive unwillingness among members of the media to officially kick Fox News to the curb of the press club” and outlines how they are going to change that through targeting elite media figures and turning them against Fox. They say they want to set up a legal fund to sue (harass) conservatives for any “slanderous” comments they make about progressives on air. They actually cite one of the best journalists around, Jake Tapper, as a problem because he questioned the White House about calling a news outlet “illegitimate.” Tapper can see the obvious: if the White House can call one news outlet illegitimate for asking tough questions, then guess who is next? Anyone.We defend freedom of the press because of the principle, not because we like everything the press does. For example, I defend MSNBC’s right to run liberal programming to their hearts content.Monitoring the media is actually a good thing; the media should be held accountable, including Fox News. When MMFA began I was supportive of their endeavor and even used some of their research. They seemed a counterbalance to conservative media monitoring organizations.But now the mask is off. They make no bones about their intentions, and it\'s not a fair media. It is clear now that the idea of freedom of the press actually offends Media Matters. In their memo, they complain about “an expansive view of legal precedent protecting the freedom of the press, and the progressive movement\'s own commitment to the First Amendment” as an impediment to be overcome or changed. They say they are “consider[ing] pushing prominent progressives to stop appearing on Fox News.” For those who defy the order, they threaten to start daily publishing the names of Democrats who appear in order to shame them. If that doesn’t work, presumably they will just shave our heads and march us down Constitution Avenue.When Anita Dunn was informing America – as a senior government official – which news organizations were “legitimate,” she conveniently deemed CNN, which rarely challenges the White House, as a “real” network. Presumably she believes MSNBC is “legitimate” also, despite their undisguised disgust of the GOP and hagiography of the president, not to mention more opinion programming than any cable outlet.I’m going to go out on a limb and assume she thinks CBS is “legitimate” after they just ran what amounted to a 2016 ad for Hillary Clinton on ""60 Minutes."" CBS is the same place that has a political director who also writes for one of the most liberal outlets in the country, Slate. Who also just wrote in that publication that the president should “pulverize” the GOP. Imagine a political director at CBS hired away from the Weekly Standard who then wrote an article about ""pulverizing"" Democrats. I know, I lost you at the part where CBS hired a political director from a conservative outlet.Last week Rolling Stone editor Michael Hastings – who is a liberal and said recently that “most journalists I know are liberal” – discussed his time covering Obama on the campaign trail. Among the things he witnessed was a reporter trying to interview Obama using a sock puppet.He told MSNBCs Martin Bashir, “That’s the presence of Obama, even on the press corps, even on the people who follow him every day. When they are near him, they lose their mind sometimes. They start behaving in ways, you know, that are juvenile and amateurish and they swoon.”Hastings admitted that the presence of Obama made him go gooey too. ""Did I ask about drones, did I ask about civil liberties? No, I did not.”I guess this is what the White House and their friends at Media Matters call the “legitimate” media.

What would that look like?In a 2010 interview on “60 Minutes,” President Obama spoke of a “new normal” in which businesses had to become accustomed to fewer employees and the American job market would never expand. When Obama and Biden left office, GDP was just 1.9 percent. Many economists and pundits believed it would not go higher. Obama and Biden and certain opinion writers claimed Donald Trump’s promise of economic growth of 3 percent or better and the return of manufacturing jobs was a “pipe dream.”FORMER OBAMA CAMPAIGN OFFICIAL: LACK OF EARLY ENDORSEMENTS FOR BIDEN COULD BE A GOOD THINGAccording to the Dept. of Commerce, economic growth has reached 3.1 percent, manufacturing jobs have returned in many industries and unemployment is at the lowest rate in nearly 50 years. Wage growth is up, as is the stock market, which, in spite of the recent dip due to uncertainty over trade with China, remains at record highs. This must be pleasing to investors and especially retirees whose IRAs and other accounts are producing more income than during the Obama-Biden years.Speaking of China, President Trump may be the first president since the communist takeover of that country in 1949 to stand up to Beijing. The Chinese have for decades been purloining American intellectual property, sending spies to steal military secrets and benefiting from unbalanced trade agreements. Biden and other Democrats have cowered in the face of all this, not wanting to “anger” the Chinese. Trump wants equal trade policies and is willing to risk a dip in the stock market to get it. When he does, watch the market skyrocket to new highs.Then there is immigration. Would a majority of voters continue to favor what has come to resemble an open-border policy that will change the character of the nation? Does Biden favor a “y’all come” status quo? All of the policies that have produced strong economic results ought to be credited to President Trump, but Biden and his fellow Democrats improbably claim it was Obama’s policies that have gifted America with such wonderment. If that were true why did none of it happen during that administration? They claim it was because it took so long to recover from the “Bush recession” that the results weren’t clear until recently.OK, then what about all of the other things Democrats have promised? They are always promising to improve education. Why, then, hasn’t education improved during previous Democratic administrations? Taxpayers are coughing up more for education. If there is a correlation between the amount spent and student achievement, wouldn’t kids be better educated and better able to compete with other countries where students excel in math and science ahead of ours?Biden and every other Democrat running for president would likely raise taxes, re-impose regulations on businesses and Wall Street and name liberal judges to the federal benches who will interpret the Constitution according to their personal biases.Would a majority of voters be OK with all of this, assuming Trump and other Republicans frame it this way?CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThen there is immigration, which, along with health care (please, Republicans, come up with a good plan that benefits the most people), will again be a major issue in the 2020 campaign.

What, if anything, will he do to assimilate and “Americanize” newcomers?No one can live in the past. There is only the present. Decisions made now will determine the future of America.

In fact, I based an entire chapter in my book ""False Alarm: The Truth about the Epidemic of Fear"" on this notion.I was wrong, as the abrupt departure from Afghanistan is showing us.

Bush Thursday on ""The Five"" at 5 pm ET.The George W. Bush Library and Museum opens this week in Dallas and many already have written about our 43rd president and his legacy. As commentators and historians hash over the big decisions, successes and mistakes over those eight years, here’s my personal take on what President Bush means to me.On election night 2000, I had never met then-Governor Bush, though I’d supported him for years. I believed he would be a strong, optimistic and gracious president with solid conservative principles and a big heart.When I got a call to volunteer on the campaign in early 2000, I had to turn it down due to a new job and a new life we were trying to start in San Diego. When I hung up the phone, I cried, “Now I’ll never get to work for George Bush. “[pullquote]More On This... George Bush says brother Jeb best man for the White HouseThen the 9/11 attacks changed everything for everyone. I moved back to D.C. and worked for the Bush administration from the fall of 2001 until the last day on January 20, 2009. Over those years, President Bush became a friend and a leader who made me strive to be a better person and citizen.Here are some of my favorite memories:• One night when I first took the deputy press secretary job, I went with him on Marine One to an event in rural Virginia for the Boy Scouts Jamboree. Weather had kept us from going for two days, but on the third night, we made it out before another storm rolled in. On the way home he insisted on sharing his peanut butter and honey sandwiches with me and the chief-of-staff, Andy Card. The sun had started setting as we left to return to the White House and we talked just like friends do – he asked me all about my family, travels, pets and goals. I remember every moment of that night – including the orange and pink sunset that lasted the whole flight.• Another time he howled when I told him how my mom had asked me about my first week at the White House, and how I’d told her all about how great it was and how Karl Rove had been so nice and helpful to me, and how he was just so smart and how happy I was to be at the White House….when I broke to take a breath my mom said, “Who the hell is Karl Rove?”• Every week he held a secure video conference either with Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki or Afghan President Karzai, and I learned from his strong but gentle guidance of them – always respectful, firm, encouraging and non-condescending. I noted that even behind closed doors, President Bush strongly, ably and graciously defended America.• He used to catch my eye during policy meetings and tip me a wink with a little smile as we had noticed when Vice President Cheney had been “resting his eyes.” Then we’d share a laugh realizing once again that it was clear the VP had heard every word.• President Bush treated my dad like the king of England when he came for a state dinner – as if his eight years in the White House never would have been complete if Leo Perino hadn’t come for a visit.• He insisted we turn the other cheek and focus on the issue, never the personal. With forgiveness came humility – not gloating and allowing others to bask in a political win. I felt like we never got to dance in the end zone, but that that was the right thing to do.• He got to know his staff and how they did their best work – some needed chiding, others needed to be pushed, but I needed reassurance. When he’d call me to the Oval Office, he’d say, “And tell her there’s nothing wrong.”• He also knew I liked to be told I was right. One day after a press conference, I said that while I thought it’d gone well, that one thing he said would be taken out of context and be the headline. He disagreed. A few hours later, I got a call in my office from the residence. It was the president. He said, “Hey, just wanted to call and tell you that you were right.” I said, “Excuse me, sir, could you repeat that?” He did. And we laughed.Mrs. Barbara Bush once told one of my Minute Mentoring events that when she talked to her son about me and to me about her son that “Loyalty goes both ways.” Indeed.I believe that leaders should inspire you to be more like them. President Bush set a high bar and I thank him for the opportunity he gave me. He was a good president and is a good friend. ', 'NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!\n  While we\'re basking in the short spring between presidential elections--sort of--it\'s time to acknowledge the debt owed by electric cars, not to today\'s crop of bureaucrats, but to the bête noire of progressives everywhere, President George W. Bush.Some critics think the electric-car subsidies in place today belong to the current White House, but those line items actually are the product of Bush\'s second term, and they\'re the root of the real electric cars you can see, buy, drive and recharge today.Before Obama raised CAFE requirements, Bush did it. And if you\'re looking for the stroke of the pen that created the burgeoning world of EVs around us, that stroke came from Bush\'s pen.Of course, any big entitlement program has many fathers and mothers. In electric cars, the parents are everyone from the engineers who worked on the Chevy Volt\'s battery pack to the team that hashed out the Leaf\'s charging system.Drilling deeper into the past, before the most recent oil shock, takes us to 2007\'s Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Presidents traditionally get credit for the actions taken below their pay grade, but in Bush\'s case, there\'s every reason to attach him to the bill beyond his signature, and to modern electric cars, reasons beyond drowning out the tired ""Halliburton big-oil buddy"" chant. After all, President Bill Clinton outmaneuvered the GOP on balanced budgets, and put his name to welfare reform--and rightly gets the win for signing his name to history.Bush gets credit for the energy bill, which was the cumulative work of both parties but landed on his desk in direct response to his State of the Union address in 2007, where he called for incentives to drive down gas consumption by 2017 within ten years. He explicitly linked gas mileage and electric cars with national security--something the EV makers themselves should be doing almost as often as they promise to green up the planet.Electric cars are real carsWith an investment of $7.5 billion, Bush and Congress underwrote $25 billion in loans that\'s translated directly into the Leaf, the Volt, Ford\'s electric Focus, the Think City, and Tesla and Fisker\'s leap from paper to plant. Now, almost five years later, we have mass-market electric cars. It\'s anathema for some progressives to give Bush credit for anything--just as it\'s anathema for more strident conservatives to see any good coming from any social engineering. They didn\'t like his prescription-drug coverage, either.It\'s worth pointing out those electric-car incentives are distinct from the GM and Chrysler bailout loans, which upended the usual bankruptcy process in the hopes of stabilizing the industry as a whole--a move still as divisive today as it was in 2008.President Obama has his own vision. He\'s angling to make CAFE a potent enforcer of electric-car mandates: Obama wants a million electric cars to hit the roads by 2015, is mandating federal agencies buy them, and is urging the EPA to keep tightening the CAFE fleet average. Electric cars may be the only way to meet a stringent new 60-mpg bogey, if the President gets his way.Obama\'s also trying to turn the federal electric-car $7500 tax credit advocated in the 2007 bill into at-dealer rebates. It\'s a step that has to happen for the Volt and Leaf to get mainstream consideration, and it\'s entirely indebted to the Bush bill.Whose side are you on?Agnostic of party affiliation, the electric-car mandates were and are political inventions for the right reasons. They reinforce a constitutional obligation with legislation, not without a little bit of cheerleading.We wouldn\'t at this place in automotive history without President Bush. To see that or admit it, you have to part a dense thicket of hater propaganda. The politically misguided, morally ambiguous invasion of Iraq is no reason to see electric cars for the win they could be, and to give credit where credit is due.Bush is still a convenient ""stupid"" joke for lazy critics who don\'t like his accent or his big, simple, long-term ideals. The war legacy isn\'t a comfortable one but like his advocacy of subsidized HIV treatment for Africa--a humane mission before it was overwhelmingly confirmed as smart science--it has undoubtedly changed a miserable situation to something less miserable. Bush was right on Afghanistan, too, which led Obama to Bin Laden.Now he\'s being proven right on electric cars, and I wonder if he\'ll ever get his due.Marty Padgett is Editorial Director for the High Gear Media family of automotive news websites.

Bush says Billy Graham changed his life The former president reflects on the reverend's impact in 2010 interview. Billy Graham was, with C.S. Lewis, one of the 20th century’s most influential figures in evangelicalism. I never had the honor of meeting Lewis, but I did know Billy, who died last week at 99. He changed my life.I first met him on my grandmother’s porch in Kennebunkport, Maine, in 1985. In her 80s, she was frail but sharp. They sat together and Billy held her hand while talking about the Bible. Later she described it as one of the most peaceful days of her life.Soon after, I had my own personal encounter with Billy. As I wrote in “Decision Points,” he asked me to go for a walk with him around Walker’s Point. I was captivated by him. He had a powerful presence, full of kindness and grace, and a keen mind. He asked about my life in Texas. I talked to him about Laura and our little girls.Then I mentioned something I’d been thinking about for a while—that reading the Bible might help make me a better person. He told me about one of the Bible’s most fundamental lessons: One should strive to be better, but we’re all sinners who earn God’s love not through our good deeds, but through His grace. It was a profound concept, one I did not fully grasp that day. But Billy had planted a seed. His thoughtful explanation made the soil less hard, the brambles less thick.He told me about one of the Bible’s most fundamental lessons: One should strive to be better, but we’re all sinners who earn God’s love not through our good deeds, but through His grace.  Shortly after we got back to Texas, a package from Billy arrived. It was a copy of the Living Bible. He had inscribed it and included a reference to Philippians 1:6: “And I am certain that God, who began the good work within you, will continue his work until it is finally finished on the day when Christ Jesus returns.”God’s work within me began in earnest with Billy’s outreach. His care and his teachings were the real beginning of my faith walk—and the start of the end of my drinking. I couldn’t have given up alcohol on my own. But in 1986, at 40, I finally found the strength to quit. That strength came from love I had felt from my earliest days and from faith I didn’t fully discover until my later years.God’s work within me began in earnest with Billy’s outreach. His care and his teachings were the real beginning of my faith walk — and the start of the end of my drinking. I couldn’t have given up alcohol on my own. I was also fortunate to witness Billy’s remarkable capacity to minister to everyone he met. When I was governor of Texas, I sat behind Billy at one of his crusades in San Antonio. His powerful message of God’s love moved people to tears and motivated hundreds to come forward to commit themselves to Christ. I remember thinking about all the crusades Billy had led over the years around the world, and his capacity to open up hearts to Jesus. This good man was truly a shepherd of the Lord.Perhaps his most meaningful service came on Sept. 14, 2001. After the 9/11 attacks, I asked Billy to lead the ecumenical service at Washington National Cathedral. It was no easy task. America was on bended knee—frightened, angry, uncertain. As only Billy Graham could, he helped us feel God’s arms wrapped around our mourning country.“We come together today,” he began, “to affirm our conviction that God cares for us, whatever our ethnic, religious or political background may be. The Bible says that he is ‘the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles.’ ” God comforted a nation that day through a very special servant.  \n      The late Rev. Billy Graham gathers with presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.\n      In a difficult moment, Billy reminded me—and us all—where we can find strength. And he helped us start to heal by offering three lessons: the mystery and reality of evil, our need for each other, and hope for the present and future. “As a Christian,” Graham said at the 9/11 service, “I have hope, not just for this life, but for heaven and the life to come.”A final story: One night while dad was away on a trip during his presidency, mother and I had dinner at the White House. Eventually we got to talking about religion and who gets to go to heaven. I made the point that the New Testament says clearly that to get to heaven, one must believe in Christ. Mother asked about the devout who don’t believe in Jesus but do God’s work by serving others. She then took advantage of one of the benefits of being first lady. She picked up the phone and asked the White House operator to call Reverend Graham.It wasn’t long before his reassuring Southern voice was on the line. He told us, as I recall, “Barbara and George, I believe what is written in the New Testament. But don’t play God. He decides who goes to heaven, not you.” Any doctrinal certitude gave way to a calm trust that God had this figured out better than I did.Those of us who were blessed to know Billy Graham benefited from his deep convictions and personal example, his wisdom and humility, his grace and purity of heart. We knew that his life was a gift from the Almighty. And I rejoice that he is now in the company of God, whom he loved so much and served so well.George W. Bush was the 43rd president of the United States. "", 'This is a rush transcript from ""On the Record,"" March 31, 2011. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: You remember September 11th, 2001? Who doesn\'t? Immediately, President George W. Bush became consumed with terrorists hiding out in Afghanistan. Now almost 10 years later his attention remains on Afghanistan, trying to help the women of Afghanistan escape oppression under the Taliban.In 2002 while still president, President Bush and Afghan President Karzai formed the U.S.-Afghan Women\'s Council. Today President Bush is still hard at work on his mission to help the Afghan women. He sat down to talk about this year\'s conversation which had a cyber-visitor, President Karzai himself.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VAN SUSTEREN: Mr. President, always nice to see you, sir.GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Greta.VAN SUSTEREN: In is a big event isn\'t it, sir?BUSH: It is. It is big because it will have an impact over the years. The idea of liberating women, empowering women, encouraging women, educating women in Afghanistan is all part of laying a foundation for lasting peace.My concern of course is that the United States gets weary of being in Afghanistan, it is not worth it, let\'s leave. And Laura and I believe that if that were to happen, women would suffer again. We don\'t believe that\'s in the interests of the United States or the world to create a safe haven for terrorists and stand by and watch women\'s rights be abused.VAN SUSTEREN: I think we forget how different it is for women in this country. We have a lot to improve, but how vastly different for women in that country.BUSH: We\'ve seen what it is like under the Taliban. Even though it was a decade ago, surely we can remember the fact that for example, young girls couldn\'t go to school and women were jailed in their own homes. If they expressed themselves publicly in a way that irritated the Taliban they were brutalized. That is not in our interests to see that kind of behavior.We liberated Afghanistan from the Taliban, because of providing a safe haven for Al Qaeda. I believed then and now we have an obligation to help this young democracy in Afghanistan survive. And thrive. And one of the best and most effective ways is to empower women.VAN SUSTEREN: I\'m curious, I imagine living the Taliban that many people developed ideas about women. Even though the Taliban is gone it is hard to escape the thought women should stay home, shouldn\'t get schooled, that the cultural ingrained aspects have to be developed as well.BUSH: That\'s true. There\'s still an inherent prejudice women in parts of Afghanistan in the big cities I\'m told that women are thriving and education system is working, and there\'s great progress. In the rural areas of Afghanistan in particular, women are still subjected to barbaric rule. So the objective is not to look and say how terrible it is. It is to think how good it can be.So part of our objective here at the Bush Center is to empower women around the world, with a special focus in places like the Mideast and Afghanistan. Part of our objective is to remind people that isolationism will subject certain people to horrors that I don\'t see how our country can live with that kind of decision.VAN SUSTEREN: The Bush administration ended and everyone scattered. Now I see many of the people, Karen Hughes, Anita McBride, they\'ve all sort of -- they still maintain their interest in the Afghanistan issue and the women there. They come back for this.BUSH: They do. A lot of us went through 9/11 and the aftermath of 9/11. Many of the women in my administration felt a call to help the women of Afghanistan. For them to come back is an extension of what has been a decade long passion.VAN SUSTEREN: And using their new jobs to partner up with these women.BUSH: Absolutely. Part of the objective is to encourage American women to mentor and help Afghan women this is not our first conference. Last year here at the Bush center we sponsored a conference on education. This happens to be a focus on entrepreneurship and business.VAN SUSTEREN: Mrs. Bush lends her star power as well to the Afghan women. I think even if she hadn\'t been the first lady, she has been helping women for a long time. I say she was with the Komen Foundation with breast cancer, addressing envelopes long before she was first lady. This is something she is immensely devoted to.BUSH: That\'s true. It started with her being an educator. Teaching young girls was a passion. Of course she became a mother and taught young girls as a mother. The extension of her early childhood and her early career to being first lady and now post first ladyship has been a natural extension for her. Particularly we it comes to focusing on women\'s rights.VAN SUSTEREN: How are your parents?BUSH: They are doing fine. They\'re turning 85 and 86 this year. The family was together a week ago last Monday honoring dad with the 1,000 points of light celebration. I will see them a week from tomorrow. I\'m trying to spend as much time with them as I can.Did you know, I am, I think the only president, maybe one of two whose both parents are alive after the presidency. So I view this as a huge blessing, a blessing I intend to take advantage of.VAN SUSTEREN: I don\'t know if you will still be alive after announcing your mother\'s age.BUSH: I don\'t know whether I will be alive.(LAUGHTER) VAN SUSTEREN: Is the library up and running?BUSH: It is. Hopefully you\'ll be talking to me in a new building in less than two years. We are excited about the progress we are making. The building is one thing and the programs are another. The programs are ongoing. Today is such a day where we have people from Afghanistan.It is going to be interesting. I know you will find this interesting is that President Karzai has agreed to talk to us via video. I think it shows one, his to continue to work with the United States, two, his desire to thank the people of the United States, and three, reflection of our friendship, and I\'m very grateful for him.VAN SUSTEREN: Thank you, Mr. President. We hope you be back before two years to see more of your programs.BUSH: Absolutely.VAN SUSTEREN: Thank you, sir.BUSH: Thanks, Greta.(END VIDEOTAPE) ', ' close  Video Bret Baier reflects on the life and legacy of Colin Powell Fox News\' Bret Baier joined \'America\'s Newsroom\' following the passing of Colin Powell Monday.NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!\n  Former President George W.

Bush\xa0and its\' stark criticism of\xa0the administration of the former president\'s son, George W. Bush.On ""Uncommon Knowledge with Peter Robinson"", the former Marine Corps General and\xa026th Secretary of Defense addressed a passage in the book\xa0""Call Sign Chaos,"" where he applauded Bush 41\'s handling of the First Gulf War and described him\xa0as a strategically-competent president.\xa0 ""President George H.W. Bush knew how to end a war on our terms.\xa0 When he said we would take action, we did... He avoided sophomoric decisions like imposing a ceiling on the number of troops or setting a date when we would stop fighting,"" wrote Mattis according to excerpts of the book.MATTIS SLAMS OBAMA, BIDEN FOR IGNORING REALITIES IN IRAQMattis said that Bush 41\'s strengths as commander-in-chief were not necessarily related to his\xa0military service.\xa0""Take a look at one of the best president\'s that we ever had, President Lincoln.\xa0 He was quite fond of saying that the only military experience that he had was fighting mosquitos when he was called up for an indian war.\xa0 I think it has to do with the degree of humility, the degree of study of history, and the degree of team building and the willingness to listen to people that may have good ideas,"" said Mattis.Strikingly, Mattis did not offer the same approval for the\xa0Bush 43 White House.Specifically, Mattis wrote about the administration\'s decision\xa0to invade the Iraqi city of Fallujah in 2004.\xa0 The assault of Fallujah marked one of the bloodiest episodes of the entire Iraq War.\xa0 As the leader of the\xa0Marine Corps troops, Mattis wrote that he advised against a full attack on the city of up to 350,000 people, but he was overruled.At that point, Mattis said\xa0that he expected the administration to be fully committed to the operation. ""I made one strong statement up the chain of command: once we assault: don\'t stop us."" Now reflecting on the Fallujah campaign, Mattis wrote, ""You don\'t order your men to risk death and then go wobbly.""""That\'s as close as you come in this book to a real display of anger,"" said Robinson. Video""It\'s frustrating because at this time the news media was full of -- unfortunately -- false reporting... there was a fair amount of political uproar over this talking about innocent people being killed... but the bottom line is -- deep inside the city -- we were ordered to halt,"" said Mattis.On May 1, 2004, U.S. forces were ordered out of Fallujah, only to be told to return again.Mattis concluded, ""In this case, I believe it was a mistake, and that was proven because some months after I left command, of course, the Marines, the soldiers, the sailors, had to go back into Fallujah and we lost hundreds more -- killed and wounded because the enemy now had time to restore their ammunition stocks, build bunkers inside homes and it was a very, very tough fight.""WATCH: MATTIS SAYS HE DIDN\'T HAVE \'TENSE\' RELATIONSHIP WITH TRUMPIn the book, Mattis also faults\xa0Barack Obama and Joe Biden\xa0for poor leadership,\xa0and suggests their ignorance of reality\xa0contributed to the\xa0rise of ISIS in Iraq,\xa0according to excerpts reviewed by\xa0The Washington Examiner.The book does not delve into Mattis\' discussions with President Trump.

My friends in Washington, D.C. say it’s a darker place than when I was there almost 20 years ago. There is less unity, less collegiality, and shockingly even less patriotism.For a couple of days this past weekend a family reunion (of sorts) in our nation’s capital hit the pause button on the caustic tone and tenor. People came by the hundreds, from 47 states, to celebrate the patriarch of an extended political family: the 43rd president of the United States, George W. Bush.The family that gathered was comprised of the hundreds of campaign and administration officials who tethered their lives to President Bush in the tumultuous first decade of this century. I was honored to be a part of it.\xa0It’s been more than ten years since Bush left office but the Bush Center’s alumni association brings us together from time to time to renew old friendships.  \n      Courtesy of the author\n      MATTIS PRAISES G.H.W. BUSH BUT NOT HIS SON, GEORGE W. BUSHThere were dozens of intimate house parties, cocktail receptions and bars filled with old friends from the political trenches. Thanks to this rather odd political family, Washington had a little more laughter, smiles, embraces and even some tears as the years and miles melted away for a few short hours.There were videos and photos of those bygone days on screens throughout the rooms where people congregated. There were stories of our raucous younger years and plenty of scrolling through photos of children and grandchildren who were only dreams when we served together in government.  One man made this far-flung group a family. One man drew us to him in such a way that we felt compelled to leave our homes, schools, communities and comfortable careers to join him on a fantastic and uniquely American journey. I assume every administration’s staff feels that way – or at least it should.Bush reminded us in strong terms that we must keep serving America in whatever capacity we could. Protecting freedom requires us all to accept the proposition that this nation can be better tomorrow than it is today because of our individual contributions to that advancement.\xa0 We were happy warriors. We were mission-focused, hard-charging, stressed-out, frustrated, and relentless in our work. We battled with a biased press in the days before people lost themselves in social media.And we knew that we were serving not just one man but an institution, which served all Americans. The president himself reminded us of that often.  \n      Courtesy of the author\n      As we reminisced, we were transported back to a time when each of us was part of what I liked to call “the great American adventure” – a journey that took us from the fields of Iowa, to the streets of Florida, to the White House and around the world.More from Opinion Rep.

There was a message. It didn’t come to me until we all gathered to hear President Bush on Saturday night.In between jokes about his grandchildren and post-presidency life, Bush reminded us in strong terms that we must keep serving America in whatever capacity we could. Protecting freedom requires us all to accept the proposition that this nation can be better tomorrow than it is today because of our individual contributions to that advancement.This family reunion was a reminder that a little bit of class and courtesy can go a long way. That any measure of success is never achieved alone. That America is still at its best when ordinary people pull together to do extraordinary things.The message to our American family is the same: Each of us must find a way to use our God-given talents, intellect and capabilities to ensure that this nation continues to be driven by optimism, opportunity, freedom and individual liberty. Whether in politics or some other form of service, Americans must live by the old axiom, “Of those to whom much is given, much is required.” Improving the human condition at home and in the far reaches of creation is only achievable with an America that is steadfast in protecting its own formula for greatness.As we went our separate ways we were inspired.

The lawyers said documents from a 2015 civil suit could “inappropriately influence potential witnesses or alleged victims.”The newly released documents include a\xa0conversation that accuser Giuffre had with her lawyers nearly 10 years ago as part of her civil case against Maxwell in 2015.At one point in the conversation, the subject turned to Epstein’s powerful friends. Jack Scarola, one of Giuffre\'s lawyers, asked her\xa0if she had any recollection of Epstein telling her that Bill Clinton owed him “favors.”“Yes I do,” she responded, according to\xa0the documents. “It was a laugh, though. He would laugh it off.\xa0 You know, I remember asking Jeffrey [a] \'What’s Bill Clinton doing here?\' kind of thing, and he laughed it off and said, ‘Well, he owes me a favor.’ He never told me what favors they were. I never knew. I didn’t know if he was serious. It was just a joke.”The lawyer\xa0asked her to clarify what she was referring to when she mentioned Clinton, and she said the former president was on the island. She said Maxwell was also there, as well as a person named “Emmy” and two young girls.“And were all of you staying at Jeffrey’s house on the island, including Bill Clinton?” Scarola asked. “And were all of you staying at Jeffrey’s house on the island, including Bill Clinton?” — Jack Scarola, deposition lawyer“That’s correct,"" she responded. ""He\xa0had about four or five different villas on his island separate from the main house, and we stayed in the villas.”“That’s correct."" — Virginia Giuffre, Epstein accuserGiuffre said sex orgies were a common occurrence there. In previous interviews, she has said she never saw Clinton behave inappropriately. A Netflix documentary titled, “Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,”\xa0includes an island tech worker\'s account of\xa0once seeing Clinton at the villa -- though only with Epstein.Angel Urena, a spokeswoman for Clinton,\xa0told the New York Post at the time that,\xa0“This was a lie the first time it was told, and it isn’t true today, no matter how many times it’s repeated.""Last year, Clinton\'s office issued a statement saying the former president had traveled aboard Epstein\'s private plane and briefly visited Epstein\'s New York City apartment -- but was always in the company of staff and Secret Service agents. Clinton also claimed to have had no knowledge of Epstein having pleaded guilty to sex crimes years ago in Florida.Fox News tried to reach Clinton\'s office after hours in connection with this story but did not receive a reply.At the 2011 meeting, Scarola continued to\xa0list\xa0names and asked\xa0Giuffre\xa0if she believed any could have information about Epstein raping underage girls.Giuffre said she believed that Les Wexner, the billionaire behind Victoria’s Secret, may have relevant information but she did not think that he would be honest. She said she believed Alan Dershowitz, the retired Harvard law professor, also had information.When reached by Fox News early Friday, Dershowitz denied any wrongdoing and claimed Guiffre had ""made up"" her claim of having met him.""The time has come to investigate Guiffre’s credibility,"" Dershowitz wrote.\xa0""She swears she saw Al and Tipper Gore on Epstein’s island. \xa0They didn’t even know Epstein. She made up the whole story. \xa0In her manuscript she admits she never met me. Says she saw me once — untrue. Says she had sex with George Mitchell and Leslie Wexner. Her lawyer denied it. She is a serial liar.""Wexner, 81, declined repeated requests for a recent report in the New York Times. The paper pointed out a letter\xa0to L Brands employees where\xa0he said he was “NEVER aware of the illegal activity charged in the indictment.”Giuffre told the lawyers she met Epstein while working at President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida when she was 15.\xa0 She said Maxwell asked her to visit Epstein at his Palm Beach mansion to learn how she could make extra money by giving him massages. Giuffre said she saw it as a great opportunity to make some extra money and her dad dropped her off. Giuffre said her father also worked at the club and thought that Maxwell came off like a “proper English lady.”Maxwell faces six counts of sex trafficking involving minors between\xa01994 and 1997. She has pleaded not guilty and the trial has been scheduled to begin in July 2021. Laura Menninger, her attorney, called the indictment “meritless.” Menninger did not immediately respond to an email from Fox News about the court’s decision to release the documents.The Epstein case has been a source of public intrigue -- particularly since last August, when the multimillionaire was found hanging inside the high-security Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City and later declared dead. He had been awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges involving underage girls. The New York City Medical Examiner’s Office ruled the death a suicide by hanging, but there has been widespread speculation that the financier was murdered. CBS\' “60 Minutes,” for example, ran a 14-minute segment titled, “Did Jeffery Epstein Kill Himself?”After Epstein\'s death, the focus on the case immediately shifted to Maxwell, 58, Epstein’s former girlfriend and accused madam.\xa0 She was arrested July 2 at her idyllic home in\xa0Bradford, N.H. She is the daughter of Robert Maxwell, the late British media magnate who once owned the New York Daily News. The elder Maxwell died in 1991, reportedly amid financial difficulties, after falling off his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine, near the Canary Islands.Ghislaine Maxwell is now seen in dozens of photos alongside Epstein\xa0at celebrity-packed events and is widely suspected to know many of Epstein’s secrets.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe trove of documents released Thursday seems to show she kept in touch with Epstein longer than was previously believed. She claimed at a bail hearing that she hadn\'t been in contact with Epstein for more than a decade. But\xa0Epstein emailed her what seems to be a statement\xa0in January 2015, which was\xa0apparently prepared for her to use when asked about their relationship, according to the documents.“Since JE was charged in 2007 for solicitation of a prostitute I have been the target of outright lies, innuendo, slander, defamation and salacious gossip and harassment,” the email read.\xa0The statement goes on to say stories about Maxwell have been wholly inaccurate, including “false allegations of impropriety and offensive behavior that I abhor and have never been a party to.”Responding to a Maxwell email a few days later, Epstein wrote: “You have done nothing wrong and I (would) urge you to start acting like it.” He suggested she go outside and hold her head high, “not as an (escaping) convict.” Fox\xa0News\' Barnini Chakraborty, Dom Calicchio, Brie Stimson and the Associated Press contributed to this report.', '   \n          next\n         Image 1 of 2 Clinton, eating ice cream during his \'anything goes years,\' compared with his healthy-diet years.

(AFP)Just how much did President Bill Clinton eat while he was in office?Roland Mesnier, the former White House pastry chef from the Carter Administration through George W. Bush, said he was astonished at Clinton\'s big appetite, calling it ""scary.""“He could eat five or six pork chops,” Mesnier said, speaking at the annual Washington Winter Show, adding that the White House kitchen staff \xa0“had to be ready.”Clinton, 65, who after leaving office famously became a vegan, had a quadruple bypass in 2004. \xa0But his reputation as an unhealthy eater was sealed in 1992, when as a new presidential candidate he took reporters on jogs to McDonald\'s. Those habits continued while in office, and he was known for his penchant \xa0for high calorie snacks, sweets and burgers.Mesnier, who for 26 years made presidential pastries, told the Washingtonian magazine that cooking for Clinton was not always easy, beginning with the fact that Clinton is allergic to both flour and chocolate.“But he loved dessert,” says Mesnier. “It made it very difficult for a pastry chef.”The French chef recalled the time when he made a strawberry cake one evening. Clinton ate half of it all by himself, and the next morning he wanted more. “No one could find the cake,” said Mesnier. “Clinton was pounding on the table and shouting, ‘I want my goddamned cake.’”Mesnier said after the cake could not be found, they could come up with just one conclusion. “We decided [Vice President Al] Gore must have eaten it.”“Every story I tell you is true,” said the affable chef, who is now a lecturer and author of three books.Clinton has lost more than 20 lbs. since changing his diet. \xa0As well as embracing a vegan lifestyle, he\'s also a believer in the raw food movement to better his health.

', ' close  Video Bill Clinton says Joe Biden helped bring America back from a recession before and he can do it again Former President Bill Clinton speaks at the second night of 2020 Democratic National Convention.NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!\n  Former President Bill Clinton took aim at President Trump in pointed terms on Tuesday,\xa0in his brief address at the Democratic National Convention.Pointing to Trump, the former president argued that “if you want a president who defines the job as spending hours a day watching TV and zapping people on social media, he’s your man. Denying, distracting, and demeaning works great if you’re trying to entertain and inflame. But in a real crisis, it collapses like a house of cards.”BIDEN FORMALLY NOMINATED AS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL STANDARD BEARERAnd criticizing the president’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, Clinton spotlighted that the U.S. has “just 4 percent of the world’s population, but 25 percent of the world’s COVID cases. Donald Trump says we’re leading the world. Well, we are the only major industrial economy to have its unemployment rate triple.”“At a time like this, the Oval Office should be a command center. Instead, it’s a storm center. There’s only chaos. Just one thing never changes—his determination to deny responsibility and shift the blame. The buck never stops there,” the former president said.Clinton painted a contrast between Trump and the leadership style of\xa0 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.“Our party is united in offering you a very different choice: a go-to-work president. A down-to-earth, get-the-job-done guy. A man with a mission: to take responsibility, not shift the blame; concentrate, not distract; unite, not divide,” Clinton said. “Our choice is Joe Biden.”And spotlighting what’s at stake in the presidential election, Clinton stressed that “you know what Donald Trump will do with four more years: blame, bully, and belittle. And you know what Joe Biden will do: build back better.”Clinton was preceded during Tuesday night’s virtual session by former President Jimmy Carter. The 95-year-old Carter noted that “when I ran for president in 1976, Joe Biden was my first and most effective supporter in the Senate. For decades, he has been my loyal and dedicated friend.”Carter said that “Joe has the experience, character, and decency to bring us together and restore America’s greatness. We deserve a person with integrity and judgment, someone who is honest and fair, someone who is committed to what is best for the American people.”SCHUMER ACCUSES TRUMP OF QUITTING ON AMERICACarter was joined by his wife Roslyn, who gave her own comments in support of Biden.Clinton’s wife, former secretary of state and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, is scheduled to speak on Wednesday night.Bill Clinton enjoyed high-profile appearances at each Democratic convention dating back to 1988, when the then-Arkansas governor gave a long-winded keynote address. Perhaps his most noteworthy speech came not during his two appearances as the nominee in 1992 and 1996 – but rather in 2012, when he stole the spotlight as he delivered a long but effective speech making the case for another four years for President Barack Obama.But this time around, the former president spoke for less than five minutes. In many ways, the former president has become an afterthought, a moderate relic in a party that’s moved to the left. This is also the first election cycle amid the #MeToo movement, and Clinton comes with the baggage of multiple sexual assault and harassment allegations – all of which he’s denied.Pointing to the past controversies surrounding the former president, the Trump campaign said that “it’s 2020 and Democrats are still honoring Bill Clinton. He’s the last person who should be giving lectures on what should or should not be happening in the Oval Office.”And the president took to Twitter minutes after Clinton spoke,\xa0to push back against the former president’s dissecting of his job combating the coronavirus.“Tell the Dems that we have more Cases because we do FAR more Testing than any other Country!” Trump tweeted, repeating an argument he’s made numerous times this summer.Factcheck.Org disputes the president’s claim.“Trump is wrong to say that testing is the only reason why cases are increasing in the U.S. On the contrary, data from some of the places being hardest hit shows that the case numbers are outpacing any increases in testing, since the percentage of positive tests is climbing — sometimes dramatically so,” Factcheck.org said.

The meeting occurred just days before the FBI decided it would not recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton.""Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about \'grandkids\'\xa0and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?"" Trump asked via Twitter at the time.JUAN WILLIAMS: TRUMP DEFENSE OF ROGER STONE SHOWS HYPOCRISY OF UPROAR OVER CLINTON-LYNCH TARMAC MEETINGSign said: “[Secret on the Tarmac] details everything that they don’t want you to know and everything they think you forgot, but Bill Clinton was on that plane for 20 minutes and it wasn’t just about golf, grandkids, and Brexit.

What are we supposed to do?’” Sign said. Video“As journalists, you have to ask yourself, why are people not delving into this? Why are we not looking into what exactly happened?Sign said that Lynch in December of 2018 testified before the House Oversight Committee.“She mentioned that Bill Clinton flattered her, talked about Eric Holder, talked about how things were going at Justice, talked about her job performance, not this golf-grandkids, Brexit.”CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPSign said that his family has received death threats for telling the story.“This story isn’t about right or left, Republican or Democrat, it’s about right and wrong and journalism.""In response, Bill Clinton said he was ""offended"" over the allegations of misconduct regarding the tarmac meeting.“I thought, you know, I don’t know whether I’m more offended that they think I’m crooked or that they think I’m stupid,” Clinton told investigators, according to a 2018 report released by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. ', "" close  Video Bill Clinton says ObamaCare doesn't work The former president criticized Obama's healthcare system during speechNEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!\n  ObamaCare has survived dozens of Republican attempts to repeal and undermine it, but a new wave of Democratic complaints -- led most recently by former President Bill Clinton -- about the cost crush facing consumers is posing a fresh challenge.Bill Clinton, on the campaign trail for Hillary Clinton, told voters in Michigan on Monday that the legislation has created a “crazy system” where millions more people have health care but those unable to qualify for subsidies are getting “killed.”“The people … out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half,” Clinton said. “It’s the craziest thing in the world.”The comments come as Republican and Democratic administrations at the state level all grapple with fresh complications from the law, as insurers threaten to leave the ObamaCare exchanges amid financial concerns and customers face the prospect of rising premiums for the plans available. Asked Tuesday about the Clinton comments, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said President Obama has “continued strong confidence” in the benefits provided under the health law.“Twenty million Americans have access to quality affordable health insurance today that didn’t have it” before, he said. At the same time, Earnest said Obama acknowledges more can be done to “further strengthen the law” – and noted Hillary Clinton has signaled interest in doing so.Amid the fallout from the ex-president’s remarks, Clinton spokesman Angel Urena clarified he was trying to speak about the “good it has done” in expanding coverage while addressing room for improvement.“And while he was slightly short-handed, it's clear to everyone, including President Obama, that improvements are needed. That’s why Secretary Clinton has proposed measures including tax relief to cover excessive out-of-pocket costs, a public option and Medicare buy-in for those over 55,” Urena said.In his remarks, Clinton also railed against the “insurance model” as a whole.Clinton’s comments in Michigan follow officials in nearby Minnesota recently agreeing to huge price hikes in order to convince insurers to stay. Commerce Commissioner Mike Rothman announced Friday that individual market plans could raise rates as high as 67 percent next year. The jump in cost follows this year’s hike of 14 percent to 49 percent.In a\xa0written statement,\xa0Rothman, who serves in a Democratic administration, said middle-class residents are getting “crushed” and called for urgent reforms in the state’s individual market.“This year the need for reform is now without any doubt even more serious and urgent,” Rothman said. He called the soaring rates “unsustainable and unfair,” while saying the steps they took were necessary to “avert a collapse this year” – after the state’s largest health insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota, announced it would stop selling health plans to individuals and families in 2017 and other insurers had threatened to follow.\n#Obamacare Sticker Shock: A look at some of the largest approved premium hikes on individual market plans for 2017 pic.twitter.com/MGpynFTLMR— Fox News Research (@FoxNewsResearch) October 4, 2016\n\nThe insurance giant said extraordinary financial losses drove its decision. The company said it was “projecting a total loss of more than $500 million in the individual [health plan] segment over three years.”Many states are facing similar challenges.“Employer markets are fairly stable, but the individual insurance market does not feel stable at all,” Janet S. Trautwein, chief executive of the National Association of Health Underwriters, told The New York Times.\xa0“In many states, the individual market is in shambles.”Democrats, who once enthusiastically supported President Obama’s landmark legislation, are feeling the heat and looking for ways to cut consumer costs.One Democrat-touted solution is the so-called public option.Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, multiple members of Congress and even Obama himself are floating it as a cure for the growing crisis.A public option -- or insurance plan offered by the government -- had been written into early versions of the bill but failed to make the final cut in the law signed by Obama in March 2010.Thirty-three Democrats signed a non-binding Senate resolution last month to add the public option to ObamaCare.Obama\xa0wrote recently\xa0in the Journal of the American Medical Association that “Congress should revisit a public plan to compete alongside private insurers in areas of the country where competition is limited.”Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley’s resolution isn’t likely to pass – since Republicans have a majority and generally oppose the idea as a way to fix ObamaCare.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and several GOP lawmakers, including Sen. John McCain, of Arizona, argue the public option isn’t an option at all.Arizona in particular is bracing for double-digit premium hikes next year.\xa0McCain, who has been a vocal opponent of ObamaCare from the start, maintains “the whole thing is collapsing like a house of cards.”“Now that the law is unraveling, it’s no surprise that Democrats are clamoring for a so-called ‘public option,’” McCain recently told FoxNews.com in a statement. “If anything is clear about this failed law, it’s that more government intervention is the wrong solution to fixing our health care system.”Cato Institute scholar Jeffrey Singer believes the public option is nothing more than a sleight of hand and “would eliminate competition, not increase it.”“Few things are more frightening for the future of American health care,”\xa0he wrote. “ObamaCare’s critics were right to predict that it would enter a death spiral; Arizonans are now experiencing it firsthand. Now we must ensure that its death spiral doesn’t take us down an even darker road.”Asked Tuesday about what might have been driving Bill Clinton’s critical comments, Donald Trump backer and ex-GOP primary rival Mike Huckabee said the former president is “telling it like it is.”“The breaking news here is a Clinton is telling the truth,” Huckabee told Fox News. “And it’s kind of refreshing.” "", ' close  Video Will the New York legislature move to impeach Cuomo? \'Special Report\' All-Star panel reacts to \'defiant\' Gov. Andrew Cuomo not backing down on allegationsEmbattled New York Democratic Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo appears to be employing the ""Bill Clinton playbook"" when it comes to simultaneously rebuffing allegations of sexual misconduct and ensuring a place in Democratic Party prominence for decades to come, according to Fox News contributor Marc Thiessen.Thiessen, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, told ""Special Report"" on Monday that there are parallels between how Cuomo conducted himself following New York State Attorney General Letitia James releasing her report, and how President Clinton acted after the Whitewater-Lewinsky probe of the 1990s.In 1997, independent counsel Kenneth Starr had been investigating Bill and Hillary Clinton\'s connections to a controversial Arkansas land deal called Whitewater when he was made aware of recordings created by Pentagon staffer Linda Tripp, in which White House intern Monica Lewinsky spoke about her sexual relationship with President Clinton.Clinton was ultimately impeached but a conviction vote failed in the Senate. Thiessen noted Tuesday that despite his impeachment and the allegations against him, the 42nd President retained his power and prominence within the party, and most recently spoke at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. Video""Cuomo has learned the lesson from Bill Clinton, that if you are shameless and unrepentant and refuse to resign, you can survive anything,"" said Thiessen.""If you want proof, despite what Bill Clinton did in office, he was invited to speak at the Democratic National Convention last year – so Cuomo looks at that and says \'Bill Clinton can survive what he survived and still be welcome at the DNC why can\'t I?\'""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThiessen added that Cuomo\'s behavior as of late is also similar to Clinton\'s in regard to ""victim shaming,"" as Cuomo is accused of harassing and retaliating against victims.""[Cuomo] said that they are doing this to score political points -- This is the Democratic state attorney general [and] I would assume all the victims who worked for him are Democrats who agree with him ideologically.

(Reuters)NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!\n  Former President Bill Clinton “casually encouraged” Donald Trump to run for president less than a year before the 2016 campaign began, according to one reporter’s tell-all memoir detailing life as a journalist covering Hillary Clinton.Amy Chozick, a New York Times reporter, released her new book “Chasing Hillary: Ten Years, Two Presidential Campaigns, and One Intact Glass Ceiling” on Tuesday.It's filled with juicy details of the drama inside the Clinton campaign during their frustrating battle against Trump. But one chapter appears to bolster past reports that Clinton's former president husband actually nudged Trump toward running in the first place.“Less than a year before the campaign started, Bill and Trump golfed together at Trump National. Bill casually encouraged Trump to run, thinking his candidacy would roil the Republican field,” Chozick wrote. “For all his political foresight, Bill spent most of the primaries oblivious that this reality TV schmo could win the Republican nomination.”This follows a Washington Post report in 2015 that described a phone conversation that spring in which Clinton reportedly encouraged Trump’s active role in the GOP. The new book's account further suggests that Bill Clinton may have unwittingly urged on the candidacy that shattered his wife's second presidential bid.Clinton apparently did not see Trump as a threat at first, but his view soon changed.Chozick suggested Clinton “insisted” Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., could “pull through,” but when Rubio dropped out of the race, Chozick wrote that the “reality set in.”  \n      Trump and Clinton have had a years-long relationship. The two reportedly golfed together weeks before the 2016 presidential election kicked off, where Clinton encouraged Trump to run.\n      (Reuters)“Bill saw genius in Trump’s economic populism and understood he was the perfect candidate for what Clinton called the ‘Instagram election’ – an era when voters wanted only bite-sized solutions,” Chozick wrote. “Hillary didn’t do bite-size.”Chozick also wrote that Bill Clinton would go “red in the face” on “almost daily” calls with the Clinton campaign’s headquarters, warning that “Trump had a shrewd understanding of the angst that so many voters—his\xa0voters, the white working class whom Clinton brought back to the Democratic Party in 1992—were feeling.”Despite Trump and Hillary Clinton's public hostility toward one another now, the book details how close Trump and Bill Clinton once were.“Bill Clinton was the best friend Donald Trump always hoped to have,” Chozick wrote of their relationship in her nearly 400-page book. Chozick wrote that during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Trump maintained that Clinton was a “terrific guy” and only criticized his “terrible” choice of Lewinsky.“He’d urged the Clintons to move into one of his Trump-branded Manhattan condos when they left the White House. They opted for a five-bedroom colonial in Chappaqua instead,” Chozick wrote. “When a Waspy Westchester golf club hesitated to accept Clinton, Donald begged him to join the Trump National Golf Club saying Clinton is a ‘great gentleman, a good golfer and a wonderful guy.’”By the time Trump became the Republican presidential nominee, the mood toward him was much different.Months after the reported golf outing, Chozick described a profanity-laced rant from the former secretary of state during a prep session ahead of a debate against Trump.“Aides understood that in order to keep it all together onstage, Hillary sometimes needed to unleash on them in private,” Chozick wrote. “’You want authentic, here it is!’ she’d yelled in one prep session, followed by a f—k-laced fusillade about what a ‘disgusting’ human being Trump was and how he didn’t deserve to even be in the arena.”Also in her memoir, Chozick touched on Bill Clinton’s controversial meeting with former Attorney General Loretta Lynch just days before former FBI Director James Comey announced he would not be recommending charges for Hillary Clinton after investigating her private email server use.“The FOBs [Friends of Bill] told me he probably was trying to influence Lynch, not directly, but just a mild charm offensive that he thought would help Hillary,” Chozick wrote, noting that one source told her “President Clinton is ‘irresponsible’ like a Fox.’” "", ' close  Video Media top headlines August 5 In media news today, CNN execs reportedly suggested Chris Cuomo take \'temporary leave\' to advise his brother, a reporter who accused Gov.
