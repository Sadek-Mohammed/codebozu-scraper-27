"['', 'Biden confronts challenges to democracy at home and abroad this weekAnalysis by Stephen Collinson, CNNUpdated 12:18 AM ET, Mon January 10, 2022 JUST WATCHEDBlinken rules out pulling back US troops, restricting NATO in Russia talks ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBlinken rules out pulling back US troops, restricting NATO in Russia talks  02:25 (CNN)President Joe Biden\'s fresh vow to save democracy faces an immediate test at home and abroad this week, with a long-shot voting rights push and the most critical US diplomacy with Russia since the Cold War.With his forceful speech on the anniversary of the January 6 insurrection last week, Biden appeared to engineer a political pivot, putting his credibility on the line to pass new laws rolling back Republican state voter suppression bills and restoring minority voting rights. He will travel to Atlanta, a city synonymous with the civil rights movement, on Tuesday, to try to dislodge the ""dagger"" he suggested ex-President Donald Trump and his Republican Party are holding ""at the throat of our democracy."" But to be successful, Biden must find a way to overcome the roadblock that has so far also derailed his social spending and climate agenda -- opposition to amending Senate filibuster rules among moderate Democrats including Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. Republicans in key battleground states renew efforts to write new rules for future elections and sow doubts about the last oneBiden\'s administration is also locked in consequential work overseas, with a flurry of talks with Russia amid US warnings that President Vladimir Putin may be poised to invade a young democracy -- Ukraine. The Kremlin is using its former satellite state as a pawn in a gambit aimed at driving NATO out of Eastern European democracies that were once within its Cold War orbit. US efforts to convince Russia to stand down will have huge implications for the geopolitical situation in Europe. And Biden\'s tussle for influence with Putin is all the more ironic since the Russian leader is not only threatening democracy across the Atlantic. He is accused by US intelligence of interfering in US elections to help Trump, the ex-President who eventually sought to deny the will of voters in 2020 by attempting a coup and who often genuflected toward the Russian leader. The talks in Europe, and Biden\'s capacity to unlock the voting rights puzzle in Washington, will be a marker of his presidential clout as he tries to bounce back after a rough political patch. The stakes of the voting rights initiative is huge, testing Democrats\' ability to protect access to the franchise, especially for minority voters, which is under threat from GOP-led legislatures inspired by Trump\'s lies. And the two-front administration push will go a long way toward deciding the outcome in the US and internationally of a presidency Biden has dedicated to safeguarding the global democracy that he says is under mortal threat.A full bore push for voting rightsRead MoreVoting rights has often seemed less of a priority than other Biden agenda items in a first year in power dominated by the pandemic and ambitious spending proposals, including the bipartisan infrastructure law that passed and the stalled social safety net bill.But both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Atlanta to build support for the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The first bill would make Election Day a public holiday, mandate same-day voter registration and allow all voters to request mail-in ballots, among other provisions. It would also reverse partisan takeovers of election administration contained in some recent GOP legislation in the states. The latter bill would restore federal government oversight of state voting laws gutted by the Supreme Court in a 2013 decision. Since Republicans universally oppose the Freedom to Vote Act and only one of their senators, Alaska\'s Lisa Murkowski, backs the measure named for civil rights hero and late Democratic Rep. John Lewis, Democrats must get around Republican use of the filibuster that requires a supermajority of 60 votes to pass most major legislation. But Manchin of West Virginia and Sinema of Arizona have been reluctant to water down filibuster rules.Senate Democrats vow they\'ll pass voting rights legislation with or without Republicans. Here\'s what their proposals would doMany Democrats are pleading with them to relent, arguing that a cascade of voter suppression laws passed by Republican-run states represents an existential threat to free and fair elections that can only be reversed by federal action in what may be the waning months of Democratic power before midterm elections in November.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, has vowed to hold a vote by Martin Luther King Jr. Day -- a week from Monday -- if Republicans do not yield. Supporters of the legislation are pushing for a limited filibuster opt-out for a voting rights overhaul and are trying to get Manchin on board -- especially given that he wrote the Freedom to Vote Act himself, after Republicans balked at an earlier bill that contained more sweeping reforms.""He pulled it together and they\'re still refusing to support it, so he has all the cover he needs to now step away and do what we need done, and that is provide the 49th vote and I hope that the 50th vote will come along,"" House Majority Whip James Clyburn said on CNN\'s ""Newsroom"" on Saturday.Speaking to Fox\'s Bret Baier on Sunday, the South Carolina Democrat increased the pressure on Manchin. He said he agreed with Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren that the Senate filibuster had ""deep roots in racism"" and should not be allowed to cement a veto for the minority.Manchin last week dealt a blow to the hopes of voting reform advocates like Clyburn, a key figure in rescuing Biden\'s then-languishing presidential campaign in early 2020 and an important ambassador to Black voters.""I\'ve always been for rules being done the way we\'ve always done, two-thirds of the members voting,"" Manchin indicated to CNN\'s Jake Tapper. He warned that getting rid of the filibuster would hurt Democrats if Republicans win back control of the Senate. ""The reason I say it\'s a heavy lift is once you change a rule or you have a carve out -- I\'ve always said this -- anytime there\'s a carve out, you eat the whole turkey. There\'s nothing left because it comes back and forth,"" he said.State legislators gear up to pass a \'tidal wave\' of voting restrictions ahead of crucial 2022 midtermsBut House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday poured more pressure on recalcitrant senators from her party, describing Republican state voting laws, which in many cases make it harder to cast ballots and easier for politicians to interfere in elections, as a ""very major threat on our democracy."" ""They are not only suppressing the vote ... they are nullifying elections,"" the California Democrat said on CBS\'s ""Face the Nation.""Republicans like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell accuse Democrats of threatening the right of states to run their own elections. Many of the new state laws, however, are justified on the grounds of ""election integrity"" -- a code word rooted in Trump\'s lies about voter fraud in the 2020 presidential vote that have been disproved multiple times.Russia and China think \'democracy\'s days are numbered\'During his January 6 anniversary speech in Statuary Hall in the Capitol on Thursday, Biden warned that foreign enemies were watching to see whether the United States safeguarded its own democracy under an unprecedented threat in modern times.""From China to Russia and beyond, they\'re betting that democracy\'s days are numbered,"" Biden said. ""They\'re betting America\'s a place for the autocrat, the dictator, the strongman.""Two of the most dangerous US foreign policy challenges involve two democracies -- Taiwan and Ukraine -- pinning their hopes of survival on American support as they exist under threat from much more powerful and proprietorial autocracies, China and Russia.Biden has personally warned Putin at several virtual summits of devastating sanctions if he orders tens of thousands of Russia troops into Ukraine to follow up on the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014. US officials will give the same message this week in talks that began on Sunday with a working dinner between Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov in Geneva. The talks will resume on Monday. Two days later, the NATO-Russia Council will convene in Brussels. The Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which includes both Russia and the United States, meets on Thursday.But there is little hope of progress. The United States argues that Russia is demanding concessions that would permanently weaken NATO in Europe with its calls for the withdrawal of troops and weapons from ex-Warsaw Pact nations. Moscow also wants assurances that Ukraine -- a former Soviet state -- will never be allowed to join the alliance.""It\'s hard to see making actual progress, as opposed to talking, in an atmosphere of escalation with a gun to Ukraine\'s head,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Tapper on ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. Ryabkov was equally downbeat, saying he was ""disappointed"" by signals from Washington and Brussels. ""In short, they reflect a lack of understanding of what we need,"" he said before laying out a wish list the West will never accept. ""We need legal guarantees, legal guarantees that NATO will not expand further, eliminate everything that the alliance has created, driven by anti-Russian phobias and all sorts of false ideas about what is the essence of Russian policy for the period since 1997."" His warning was chillingly resonant of late 20th century clashes between two ideologically opposed superpowers. While talk of a second Cold War now often refers to a building American clash with China rather than Russia, there is one big difference between the period between the end of World War II and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Back then, the challenge to America democracy came mostly from abroad. Now, it is under siege at home.', 'Rep. Jim Jordan indicates he won\'t meet with January 6 committeeBy Greg ClaryUpdated 11:51 PM ET, Sun January 9, 2022 JUST WATCHEDA year after January 6th, Republicans still push election liesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHA year after January 6th, Republicans still push election lies 03:20 (CNN)Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio indicated he doesn\'t plan to cooperate with a request to meet to meet with the House select committee investigating January 6, according to a defiant letter he sent to committee Chair Bennie Thompson on Sunday.While Jordan -- a top congressional ally of former President Donald Trump -- did not explicitly say he will not cooperate with the committee, his four-page letter outlines his grievances with the panel and its request. The Ohio Republican wrote that he has ""no relevant information that would assist the Select Committee in advancing any legitimate legislative purpose.""Jordan, one of Trump\'s top congressional allies, did not explicitly say he will not cooperate with the committee, his four-page letter outlines his grievances with the committee. Jordan wrote that he has ""no relevant information that would assist the Select Committee in advancing any legitimate legislative purpose.""Jordan does, however, appear to have relevant information for the committee\'s probe into the insurrection. He has been identified as one of the lawmakers who sent a text message to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, in the leadup to the US Capitol attack, which the committee has in its possession. The message that Jordan forwarded to Meadows on January 5 outlined a legal theory that then-Vice President Mike Pence had the authority to stand in the way of the certification of the 2020 election.A January 6 select committee spokesperson said in response to Jordan\'s letter that because Jordan spoke with Trump on January 6, 2021, he does have information the committee is seeking and is a ""material witness.""Read More""Mr. Jordan\'s letter fails to address the principal bases for the Select Committee\'s request for a meeting, including that he worked directly with President Trump and the Trump legal team to attempt to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election. Mr. Jordan has admitted that he spoke directly to President Trump on January 6th and is thus a material witness. Mr. Jordan\'s letter to the committee fails to address these facts,"" the spokesperson said.Although the committee doesn\'t mention a subpoena in its response, it also doesn\'t rule it out.""The Select Committee will respond to this letter in more detail in the coming days and will consider appropriate next steps,"" the spokesperson said.The committee also suggested, without evidence, that Trump and his team are the reason Jordan is not cooperating.""Mr. Jordan has previously said that he would cooperate with the committee\'s investigation, but it now appears that the Trump team has persuaded him to try to hide the facts and circumstances of January 6th,"" the committee\'s spokesperson said.CNN has reached out to Trump for comment regarding the allegation.Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, had requested Jordan\'s cooperation, asking him for a voluntary meeting in a December letter as the panel zeroed in on Republican lawmakers who may have significant knowledge of events leading up to the Capitol attack.""We understand that you had at least one and possibly multiple communications with President Trump on January 6th. We would like to discuss each such communication with you in detail,"" Thompson wrote.""And we also wish to inquire about any communications you had on January 5th or 6th with those in the Willard War Room, the Trump legal team, White House personnel or others involved in organizing or planning the actions and strategies for January 6th,"" the letter states, referencing in part an election-related ""command center"" for Trump allies at the Willard InterContinental hotel in Washington, DC, around January 6.Jordan previously warned the committee that targeting GOP lawmakers in any capacity would be met with political retribution if Republicans win the House in November\'s midterm elections. He was originally selected by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to be one of five GOP members serving on the committee back in July, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected McCarthy\'s selection of Jordan, along with GOP Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, because she said their appointments could impact the ""integrity of the investigation."" Pelosi\'s decision led McCarthy to pull all five of his members, which further soured the willingness between the two parties to work together, and led Pelosi to select GOP Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger to serve on the panel.In his Sunday letter, Jordan said the committee\'s request was ""far outside the bounds of any legitimate inquiry, violates core Constitutional principles, and would serve to further erode legislative norms."" He did not mention any communications with Trump.The committee had asked to meet with Jordan on January 3 or 4 or the week of January 10, when the House is back in session. The committee also offered to meet with Jordan in his home district.""Even if I had information to share with the Select Committee, the actions and statements of Democrats in the House of Representatives show that you are not conducting a fair-minded and objective inquiry,"" Jordan wrote.In December, Republican Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania declined the committee\'s request to speak with him. Perry, the incoming chair of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus, was the first known lawmaker to whom the panel had reached out to talk for its investigation.

(CNN)In Michigan, a group of Donald Trump\'s supporters is working on a petition to mandate an outside audit of the 2020 election and establish a grand jury with the power to arrest election officials who refuse to cooperate. In Wisconsin, some GOP lawmakers are trying to sideline a bipartisan commission that oversees elections in the state.And Republican legislators from Arizona to Florida are planning to take up new voting restrictions in upcoming legislative sessions.As a likely showdown looms in Congress this week over federal voting legislation, Republicans aligned with the former President are pressing ahead at the state level to change voting procedures, conduct partisan investigations of the last presidential contest and seize more control over the machinery of elections.Democrats and voting rights advocates warn that the unrelenting campaign to cast doubt on the legitimacy of President Joe Biden\'s 2020 victory over Trump could erode voter confidence in elections and increase the chances that losing candidates and their supporters will challenge the results of free and fair elections in the future.Read More""Every day that goes by, I am more and more concerned about the direction and resilience of American democracy,"" said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research. ""I\'m worried that we are heading down a path where there are those who cannot accept that ... their candidate could lose.""Recent polling underscores the peril.  A CBS News-YouGov poll found that more than 6 in 10 of Americans said they now expect violence over the loss of future presidential elections. And a separate poll from The Washington Post and the University of Maryland found that about one in three Americans think violent action against the government is sometimes justified.The Post-UMD poll also exposed a stark partisan divide: 40% of Republicans and 41% of Independents said violence against the government could be justified versus 23% of Democrats.\'Slow-moving insurrection\'In the last year, 19 states passed 34 laws that restrict voting in some way, according to an analysis by the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice. And more changes are expected as state legislatures convene early this year. Brennan\'s analysis found 88 restrictive bills introduced last year will carry over into upcoming legislative sessions, and that 13 new bills had been pre-filed as of last month.  The new proposals include a measure that would ban the use of drop boxes in Georgia -- where Biden became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state in 28 years. An Arizona lawmaker wants to establish stricter voter ID requirements. In Florida, a state Trump won handily, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis is pushing a new package of voting measures that includes increasing penalties for collecting voters\' ballots and establishing a new office to investigate and prosecute election fraud.Meanwhile, in Michigan, where Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer vetoed several GOP-sponsored election bills last year, Republican activists are collecting signatures to attempt an end-run around the governor.The initiative would establish new voter ID requirements, along with barring election officials from sending absentee ballot applications to all voters. The state, which Biden won by about 154,000 votes, saw record turnout in the last presidential election, with some 3.2 million voters casting absentee ballots.Under a quirk in the state constitution, if the Secure MI Vote organizers gather at least 340,047 valid signatures in support of their initiative, the GOP-controlled House and Senate can enact the changes without Whitmer having the power to veto it.Jamie Roe, a spokesman for the group, said volunteers are ""on the path"" to reaching their goal but declined to say how many signatures they have collected.Trump loyalists in Michigan also are seeking state approval to circulate a second petition that would mandate a third-party ""audit"" of the 2020 election. Republican state legislative candidate Jon Rocha, one of the petition\'s backers, told CNN that he believes Trump prevailed in Michigan in 2020 and said there have been ""enough inconsistencies"" to warrant a ""forensic audit"" of results.If successful, the audit initiative would establish a grand jury with power to subpoena evidence and issue arrest warrants for those ""impeding or otherwise stalling"" the audit\'s progress. There has been no evidence of widespread fraud in Michigan. And last June, a committee led by Republican legislators in the state debunked a raft of fraud claims pushed by Trump and his allies. Trump aides did not respond to requests for comment, but the former President has maintained an intense focus on Michigan. Last November, he castigated the state\'s Republican legislative leaders as ""cowards"" and ""spineless"" for refusing to agree to his demands for an audit of the 2020 election.The former President has endorsed Rocha\'s candidacy -- along with a clutch of other statewide and legislative candidates in Michigan who have questioned the legitimacy of the 2020 election.Mark Brewer, a former Michigan Democratic Party chairman who practices election and campaign finance law, said the activity by Trump loyalists feels like ""a slow-moving insurrection that I think is laying the groundwork to undermine elections in 2022 and 2024.""Wisconsin showdownIn Wisconsin, a swing state where the last two presidential elections have been decided by narrow margins, the battles over election administration have grown more heated.A months-long Republican investigation of the 2020 election ordered by the Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos has extended into the new year. Michael Gableman, a former state Supreme Court justice Vos hired to oversee the probe, recently issued a new round of subpoenas, seeking more information from municipal city officials and the Wisconsin Elections Commission, an election agency overseen by a bipartisan board.Ann Jacobs, a Democratic lawyer from Milwaukee who serves as the elections commission\'s chairwoman, said Gableman\'s team recently delivered an ""insanely broad"" subpoena to an IT employee at the agency. It demanded ""any and all communications"" about the 2020 election between the employee and any other person since January 1, 2020, she said.Gableman previously asked a judge to arrest two mayors after failed attempts to compel the officials to testify behind closed doors and provide documents. Court cases related to Gableman\'s subpoenas are pending.Gableman\'s office did not respond to CNN interview requests. Vos spokeswoman Angela Joyce said in an email Friday that the Speaker has asked Gableman for recommendations by February that could help shape new laws this year during the legislative session.A recount and court rulings have affirmed that Biden won Wisconsin by a little more than 20,600 votes out of 3.3 million cast. And independent reviews by the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau and the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty have not found any widespread fraud. The reviews have called for updates to the commission\'s policies and state laws.Republicans have attacked the election agency for months over issuing guidance to local election clerks that eased voting rules during the pandemic. One county sheriff recommended felony charges against five of the commissioners.A new proposal circulating among legislators from GOP state Rep. Timothy Ramthun would dissolve the commission and transfer its duties to the secretary of state. He did not respond to interview requests from CNN.US Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican, has gone further, suggesting that the GOP-controlled state legislature seize oversight of federal elections in the state, bypassing the elections commission. The idea has received a cool reception from state legislative leaders so far.Johnson, however, has not backed down, citing a portion of the US Constitution that gives state legislatures the authority to establish the ""times, places and manner"" of federal elections. ""It\'s time for the state legislature to reclaim its constitutional authority over federal elections and make sure that our election clerks follow the law,"" he said, in part, in a statement to CNN.Jacobs, the commission\'s chairwoman, said the rhetoric about elections in Wisconsin has moved into a ""much more insidious and much more dangerous"" direction than ever before. ""This cannot be what\'s accepted as normal,"" she said.CNN\'s Devan Cole contributed to this story.', 'Is there a version of Biden\'s economic plan that Joe Manchin can support?Analysis by John Harwood, CNNUpdated 5:58 PM ET, Sun January 9, 2022 JUST WATCHEDDead or alive? A look at the status of Biden\'s Build Back Better billReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDead or alive? A look at the status of Biden\'s Build Back Better bill 13:30 (CNN)In 2009, Senate Democrats spent months courting Republican Charles Grassley in search of bipartisan support for the Affordable Care Act. By that September, President Barack Obama had lost patience.""Let me ask you a question, Chuck,"" Obama said in an Oval Office meeting he recounted in his 2020 memoir. ""Are there any changes -- any at all -- that would get us your vote?""""I guess not, Mr. President,"" Grassley replied, concluding negotiations.Is Sen. Joe Manchin now reprising Grassley\'s role on President Joe Biden\'s Build Back Better plan? If so -- if nothing can ultimately get the West Virginia Democrat to ""yes"" -- then more wheedling represents a waste of time. The legislation cannot pass without him.But the White House and party leaders, believing they cannot afford to fail, maintain hope that Manchin\'s vote can be won. That means exploring ways to reshape Biden\'s plan to meet the senator\'s objections.How months of talks between Biden and Manchin over Build Back Better broke down Read MoreIn theory, that shouldn\'t be so hard.Like the President, Manchin agrees an acceptable package could spend $1.75 trillion over 10 years. Before his bombshell pre-Christmas announcement of opposition to the House-passed version of the massive tax and spending bill that would expand the nation\'s social safety net, he had handed Biden a $1.8 trillion version.That\'s roughly half the President\'s original proposal, but other congressional Democrats have made clear they can accept that reduction. The challenge is determining how to spend it.As they whittled the price tag last year, House Democrats decided against culling many programs from Build Back Better. Instead, they financed them for only part of the 10-year span used in budget legislation, figuring a later Congress wouldn\'t let the money run out. Manchin complains that ""gimmick"" obscures the plan\'s true long-term cost. He\'d rather discard some proposals and fully fund those that remain. Sen. Joe Manchin speaks to reporters outside his office on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, January 4, 2022. That would inflict pain on Democratic union and social service constituencies that yearn for more money. Yet $1.75 trillion could still finance major priorities Democrats appear to agree on. Championing his coal-producing state, Manchin slams as unduly punitive some Build Back Better proposals to ameliorate climate change. But he insists he supports most of the bill\'s climate provisions. Overall, they cost $550 billion.Manchin also backs new subsidies to help parents obtain child care and prekindergarten education for 3- and 4-year-olds. Permanent funding for those parts of Build Back Better, the Congressional Budget Office estimates, takes $752 billion. Nor has Manchin objected to more financial help for Americans seeking health insurance under the Affordable Care Act (which Congress finally enacted in March 2010 without Grassley\'s support). Permanent funding for those Build Back Better provisions, CBO says, would cost $428 billion.A bill with those elements -- on climate change, child care, prekindergarten and Obamacare -- would represent a major advance for Democratic priorities. And the cumulative $1.73 trillion cost would fit Manchin\'s compromise budget.\'I\'m kind of speechless\': Democrats scramble to salvage climate provisions after Manchin sinks Build Back BetterOf course, that list omits hundreds of billions\' worth of other Biden proposals, including money to expand the housing supply, raise home health care workers\' pay, add hearing benefits under Medicare and augment the Earned Income Tax Credit for childless adults.More politically precarious, it also omits the Build Back Better provision many Democrats value most: an expanded Child Tax Credit that analysts say reduces childhood poverty by 40%. Manchin says too much of the money -- more than $1 trillion over 10 years if funded permanently -- would be squandered by undeserving recipients.Yet just a tiny fraction of that investment would deliver much of the benefit Democrats seek.For $50 billion over 10 years, the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities projects, Congress could cut child poverty 20% without even increasing the maximum Child Tax Credit that this administration inherited from President Donald Trump. The reduction would come from making the pre-Biden credit ""fully refundable"" -- available even to parents who don\'t earn enough to generate federal income tax liabilities.That\'s something Manchin does oppose, insisting it gives some parents without jobs money to spend on drugs rather than their children. But if fellow Democrats could persuade him to compromise, adding Child Tax Credit refundability would partially address their priority while leaving the cost of a revised Biden plan below $1.8 trillion.10 things you didn\'t know are in the Democrats\' Build Back Better billManchin also fears Build Back Better spending would expand the budget deficit and exacerbate inflation. But deficit hawks at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget say Biden has specified more than $2 trillion in bona fide financing sources, while economists in both parties envision the bill having a negligible inflationary impact.In other words, a hypothetical package along these lines would seem to meet Manchin\'s concerns. The question is whether his stated objections can be taken at face value.In the 2020 election, Trump defeated Biden in West Virginia by 39 percentage points -- a larger margin than anywhere except Wyoming. With a coal-loving constituency like that, perhaps Manchin -- like Grassley on Obama\'s health care plan -- simply cannot bring himself to push Biden\'s economic and climate agenda over the finish line.That did not, however, stop him from joining the party-line vote to pass Biden\'s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan last March. The next few weeks will tell whether the White House and Democratic leaders can make it happen again.', 'Wisconsin Sen.

We\'re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. (CNN)In Christian tradition, January 6 is the feast of the Epiphany, which marks both an ending and beginning. It\'s the twelfth day after Christmas, and, if you observe, celebrates the revelation of divinity shown to the three Magi when they visit the human baby Jesus.  The word ""epiphany"" -- which the Oxford English Dictionary defines as a ""manifestation"" or ""striking appearance, especially an appearance of a divinity"" -- also connotes more secular forms of incarnation. A sudden idea or unexpected perception, a breakthrough, an upending of the ordinary. Poet Mary Oliver, whose work some theologians cite in connection with moments of spiritual revelation, writes in an oft-quoted passage from her poem ""Sometimes"":  Instructions for living a life:Pay attention. Be astonished.Tell about it.Read More This year, as it was in 2021, January 6 was something more than Epiphany, and will forever be marked as a wound in America\'s collective memory, but it\'s still worth asking what was being made manifest in the United States on this day a year ago, and what\'s appearing to us now. ""I woke up knowing it was going to be a difficult day, but I had no idea that it would take the harrowing turn that it did,"" recalled Rep. Colin Allred, who described texting his wife, ""Whatever happens, I love you"" as a ""violent mob of Trump supporters was descending on the US Capitol."" When members of Congress returned that evening to finalize the election result, said Allred, ""Democracy held, but it showed dangerous signs of fracturing."" Farai Chideya, who was covering the ""Stop the Steal"" rally in downtown Washington, DC and reflected on what she\'s learned in the year since, wrote in terms redolent of Oliver\'s ""instructions for living a life"" when she observed parallels between the day\'s violence and the unrest depicted in protests over busing in the year of America\'s bicentennial: ""really, it was over democracy: who is part of it; who is excluded; and who gets to tell its story."" Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion\'s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook Chideya, who has been reporting about extremism for many years, proposed steps journalism and civil society alike can take to avoid ""watching democracy burn"" -- stop treating extremists like an other, and most of all, ""be prepared to live in psychic discomfort over the state of American democracy, and do so indefinitely. Just as we are learning to adapt to the pandemic, to the fatiguing array of choices we face under pain of death or illness, we can learn to adapt to an America where we have to face threats to democracy head-on.""  Those threats are chillingly real and continue to grow, argued Peter Bergen, because while the insurrection at the US Capitol was a peak of contemporary White nationalism in America, it was also ""a dress rehearsal for what will likely come next.""  Bergen connected the dots between a White nationalist past defined by racists like William Luther Pierce and Louis Beam and a present reflected in polls showing over three quarters of Republicans falsely believe Biden did not win the 2020 presidential election and one in three Americans ""endorses the view that violence against the government is sometimes justified.""   Peniel E. Joseph outlined how two opposing historical forces -- reconstructionism and redemptionism -- have defined American historical memory since the post-Civil War moment and still have the power to shape US democracy in 2022: ""these competing worldviews continue, for better and worse, to forge our national identity. But they do not predetermine our destiny unless we let them.""  Where do we go from here?  President Joe Biden\'s speech on the anniversary of January 6 signaled a stark shift in his approach to the nation\'s ongoing crisis of democracy, Frida Ghitis wrote. Jabbing at former President Donald Trump for his role in setting the stage for the insurrection -- mentioning him 16 times without uttering his name -- Biden\'s ""words and delivery were quite a contrast from the Biden whose speeches, especially those dealing with democracy and the future of the nation, have tended to emphasize national unity and reconciliation. The shift reflected a recognition that the insurrection of January 6 is not simply a part of the past, but a looming threat into the future.""   Former President Jimmy Carter warned in the New York Times: ""Our great nation now teeters on the brink of a widening abyss. Without immediate action, we are at genuine risk of civil conflict and losing our precious democracy."" But where must America go from here?  In the Wall Street Journal, Karl Rove urged his fellow Republicans to hold themselves accountable for the events of January 6 and asked them to answer the question: What would you have done if Democrats did this?  The perils confronting American democracy now are the result of deeper forces, noted Laura Coates. Accountability for the events of January 6 goes hand in hand with a push for voting rights, Coates wrote: ""It would be foolish to investigate an insurrection without continuing parallel investigations by the Department of Justice into state laws that target minority voters by adopting laws with discriminatory features, that actively seek to disenfranchise them, and gerrymandered districts that dilute their voting power and strength."" She emphasized the ""Big Lie"" that Trump was denied a victory through election fraud ""remains false, but the self-evident truth is that our democracy is under attack by those who keenly understand the power of the vote. It is not widespread voter fraud that they fear; it is widespread voter participation.""  The political polarization of the last year and Congress\'s failures to implement reforms to protect democracy have made it all the more ""urgent for Americans outside of government to redouble their efforts to safeguard democratic governance and the values that underwrite it,"" cautioned Nicole Hemmer. She laid out four things ordinary Americans can do to support and protect democracy: Tell the truth about January 6, talk about values instead of norms, engage in local activism and invest in reviving civic life and institutions.

""Several justices went out of their way to say they were not against vaccines, but they were against government mandates,"" Toobin pointed out. ""Whatever the reasons that ultimately justify the rulings, the most likely outcome for the country seemed clear: fewer required vaccinations and testing, likely leading to greater sickness and even more death.""  The arguments and their outcome could also foreshadow the conservative majority\'s broader view of executive power, analyzed Jennifer Rodgers -- ""the ruling may provide a window into the court\'s thinking that may be instructive to lower courts and serve as a precursor of what will happen when the court is faced with the same or similar issue in the future.""  \'The kids are not ok\'Anushay Hossain and LaylaWhen her daughter -- too young to be vaccinated -- contracted Covid-19 after an outbreak in her pre-kindergarten classroom, Anushay Hossain and her husband ""spent a few sleepless nights fighting to bring her 103-degree fever down as our little warrior coughed and struggled with congestion."" Thankfully, she recovered, but ""the experience was still traumatic,"" stressed Hossain, who ""can\'t stop thinking about how, as a country, the US just can\'t seem to effectively prioritize the well-being of children"" when it comes to Covid policies or access to necessary resources like mental health support or affordable child care. ""The kids are not OK,"" she insisted. Neither are the parents, argued SE Cupp -- the confused Covid-19 messaging is exhausting, as is grappling with the difficult decision to send kids to school or not. Parents are flooded with anxiety, stoked by rapid Omicron spread, fuzzy guidance and bad actors in politics and at some right-wing media outlets who are exploiting the trauma. She concluded: ""It\'s okay to demand better of our public health officials without calling into question their motives or the whole of science. We\'ll get through this if we can drown out the noise, ignore the nonsense and focus on the things we know have worked.""  Of the contentious question of schools, Dr. Leana Wen wrote for the Washington Post: ""It\'s wrong for politicians to stop the use of readily available mitigation measures such as masks. But it\'s equally wrong to argue that unless every protection is in place, schools cannot remain open.""  More perspectives:  Dr. Richard Besser: ""Why it\'s impossible for some people to follow Covid-19 guidelines"" Jill Filipovic: ""2022: Like 2020, but with more disasters""   What the Novak Djokovic saga revealed  On Tuesday, tennis star Novak Djokovic (who has not volunteered his vaccination status and has spoken out against the Covid-19 vaccine) announced tournament officials had granted him a medical exemption to play at the Australian Open, touching off a firestorm of international controversy.  After traveling to Australia on a visa which, according to Prime Minister Scott Morrison, does not permit medical exemptions for the unvaccinated, Djokovic remained at the airport and, as Stephanie Myles wrote, ""is now a man in limbo, staying in a hotel used as an immigration detention center, and which has since become a magnet for protesters of all stripes -- from Djokovic supports to refugee advocates.""  The hearing concerning his appeal of the visa cancellation has been adjourned until Monday, said Myles, so Djokovic remains a man in limbo for now, and a man who\'s ""never been particularly good at reading the room"" for a good while longer than that. ""In the end, Djokovic\'s hubris hasn\'t helped. But no one"" -- not the various levels of government, not tennis leadership -- ""comes out of this looking good,"" observed Myles, especially to an Australian fan base which has suffered through some of the harshest lockdowns in the world and has a culturally ingrained sense of fair play. Documents published on Saturday by Australia\'s Federal Circuit Court showed Djokovic was granted a medical exemption to compete after recently recovering from Covid-19.  Elizabeth Holmes\' conviction  After months of testimony and seven days of deliberations, a jury found Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes guilty on four charges of defrauding investors and acquitted her of four other charges. The jury failed to reach a verdict of three additional charges. Overall, this result is still a ""stark rebuke of the defense, which attempted to portray Holmes as a visionary leader who fell victim to subordinates who misled her and investors who misunderstood her"" wrote Jessica A. Roth for CNN Business Perspectives.  The verdict also constituted a ""welcome rejection of the dubious gender stereotypes"" the defense ""rolled out in an effort to secure her acquittal,"" opined Lara Stemple for Slate. ""By arguing that Holmes, whose company was once worth billions, was merely a victim working under the direction of her male business partner, the defense advanced a perspective that risked undermining the fragile gains women have made in tech and business,"" Stemple wrote. What would Betty White do? ""With a life that spanned nearly a century — including more than seven decades in the TV business — it\'s impossible to adequately represent Betty White\'s legacy in a single tribute. And since her death at the age of 99 on December 31 many remembrances have focused on her iconic work as an actor and her award-winning performances,"" Elizabeth Yuko wrote. ""But the perpetually sweet (occasionally foul-mouthed) grande dame of television had a massive and often overlooked influence on American culture off-camera as well.""  In addition to her life as ""TV\'s original trailblazing feminist"" (co-founding a production company in 1952 and becoming the first woman to produce a national television show), White was a vocal supporter and advocate for civil and human rights for decades and was outspoken (in interviews as early as the 1950s) in her efforts to ""normalize and destigmatize the idea that a woman didn\'t have to meet a man, get pregnant and raise a family in order to be considered successful.... Intentional or accidental, White\'s progressive approach has left a visible impact on both the entertainment industry and American culture at large.""

As far as Black male film stars go, Seymour noted, ""Without Sir Sidney Poitier, there is no Billy Dee Williams, Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, Eddie Murphy, Forest Whitaker, Michael B. Jordan or, for that matter, that other Michael Jordan, whose ability to parlay his fearsome basketball skills into a cross-cultural, multimedia hyphenate was at least partly enabled by Poitier, who made it safe for Black culture heroes in all kinds of endeavors to connect with Whites as well as other Blacks.""  After his last film in 2001, Poitier received another Oscar for lifetime achievement, and, as Seymour pointed out, ""He had reached the kind of iconic stature once reserved solely for such male icons as John Wayne, James Cagney and Cary Grant. That same night, Poitier got to watch both Denzel Washington and Halle Berry receive lead acting Academy Awards, with Berry being the first Black actress to receive the award. You can\'t say for certain, but you have to believe that Poitier believed those latter two events represented a greater, more significant recognition of his long quest for acceptance and achievement than another gold statuette.""', 'Border Patrol officers rescued 25 migrants from a locked, freezing trailer in TexasBy Alaa Elassar, CNNUpdated 6:00 AM ET, Sun January 9, 2022 This photo shows a US Border Patrol patch on a border agent\'s uniform.

They do not care about the lives and welfare of the migrants they smuggle, only about the money they can make from exploiting them.""Issues at the borderTens of thousands of migrants arrive at the US border each week, with record-setting numbers of unaccompanied minors among them. The spike in numbers has once again overwhelmed an unprepared US immigration system, which has faced this type of crisis repeatedly in years past but has yet to resolve entrenched problems like overburdened asylum courts and facilities ill-equipped for housing children.Officials are also up against human smugglers who play a massive role in facilitating the illegal crossings of migrants at the border.President Joe Biden and his top advisers have been working to devise solutions to the situation, including scaling up capacity to house unaccompanied children and working with Mexico to help manage the flow of migrants from Central America.US authorities have made nearly 1.66 million arrests for unlawful crossings on the US-Mexico border over the past year, the highest annual number of apprehensions on record, according to year-end data released by the CBP.Since taking office, the Biden administration has struggled to manage the unprecedented number of migrants crossing into the US, faced early on with an influx of children that overwhelmed resources, and most recently, caught off guard by thousands of migrants arriving within days to the unprepared region of Del Rio, Texas.The number of monthly border arrests -- a measure of unlawful crossings -- skyrocketed under the Biden administration, though they began to rise under former President Donald Trump.', 'Sen.

The 61-year-old is currently serving his third term as a senator from South Dakota and is widely seen as the likely successor to the longest-serving Senate Republican leader in history, Mitch McConnell.He\'s been at odds with former President Donald Trump before, most recently when Trump encouraged current South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to run against Thune in the election. Thune had been one of the top Republicans to speak in favor of accepting the Electoral College results and President-elect Joe Biden\'s victory in the 2020 election, drawing Trump\'s ire.He said for weeks he was waiting to make his decision as he had been struggling with whether to seek another six-year term.Read MoreAhead of the crucial 2022 midterms, there have been a few high-profile, long-serving establishment Republicans who have announced they won\'t seek reelection in 2022 and retire once their term is up. Those Republicans include Sens. Roy Blunt of Missouri, Rob Portman of Ohio, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Richard Shelby of Alabama and Richard Burr of North Carolina.Still, Republicans have not been been hit as hard with retirements in the House as Democrats, putting the GOP in a good position to defend their seats while picking up other congressional seats. Thune, a former House lawmaker and DC lobbyist, was first elected to the Senate in November 2004, defeating then-Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, a Democrat.  He ran unopposed in November 2010 and won his third term in the Senate in 2016.

Bennie Thompson, the committee\'s chairman, told NPR that the committee will meet next week to discuss offering Pence a formal invitation to voluntarily appear. ""I think you could expect that before the month\'s out,"" the Mississippi Democrat said of the invitation to Pence.Pence certified the 2020 presidential election despite an extensive pressure campaign led by then-President Donald Trump and his allies to halt the process.A committee aide confirmed to CNN that the group is considering an offer for Pence to appear, but a final decision has not been made.""The Chairman\'s comments indicate that the Select Committee is contemplating issuing an invitation to the former Vice President sometime this month,"" the aide said in a statement.Read MoreWhile the option of inviting Pence to appear is under discussion, another source connected to the committee made it clear it is something the members still need to hash out before moving forward.""The committee is taking a responsible and considered approach to these matters and will address these issues in an appropriate fashion and at an appropriate time,"" the source said.Rep. Adam Schiff, a member of the select committee, told CNN\'s Wolf Blitzer on Friday that the committee is interested in talking to Pence and that asking him to appear is one of the options they are considering.""As the chair has indicated, we intend to extend that invitation fairly soon,"" the California Democrat said.Schiff, however, would not comment on whether the committee would take the step of issuing a subpoena if Pence turned down its offer.""Mike Pence knows things that only Mike Pence knows and it would be very important to completely fill out our work and I think this is one more public service that needs to be performed by the former Vice President,"" he said.Rep. Liz Cheney, the vice chairwoman of the committee, had told NBC on Thursday she was looking forward to Pence\'s cooperation and his team ""continuing"" their cooperation in the panel\'s investigation, calling the former vice president a ""hero"" for his actions that day.Speaking to CNN\'s Jake Tapper later Thursday -- the one-year anniversary of the insurrection, the Wyoming Republican said she thinks Pence ""played a very important consequential role"" on January 6. ""Making sure we could carry out our constitutional duties. I am confident he wants the American people to know the truth. He loves this country, and he will want to make sure this committee is successful,"" she said.The vice president had acted as a ""constitutional patriot"" on the day of the attack, Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat serving on the committee, told CNN on Thursday.CNN first reported the committee\'s interest in talking to Pence on Tuesday.As previously reported, Thompson said the former vice president\'s unique role on January 6 is a key part of what the panel needs to understand.Pence\'s decision to disregard the pressure campaign he was under, Thompson previously said, put the former vice president at extreme risk from the rioters on the day of the attack.""His life was at risk,"" Thompson said at the time. ""There were people who had gallows erected on the lawn of the Capitol ostensibly to hang the vice president. There were people on them threatening the life of the vice president.

(Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images) (CNN)Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows is urging the Supreme Court to take up former President Donald Trump\'s case aiming to keep secret records from his presidency about efforts to overturn the 2020 election and the January 6 insurrection -- as he, like Trump, tries to evade a House select committee\'s investigation into the attack on the US Capitol.In a brief filed Friday, Meadows, who is facing a potential criminal contempt charge for failing to comply with the House January 6 committee\'s subpoena, argued that the Supreme Court should allow former presidents to have a say in the secrecy of the executive branch and that the high court should put limits on what he claimed is an ever-expanding approach to congressional investigations. In his lawsuit, Trump claimed executive privilege should allow him to block the select committee from getting some of the documents from the National Archives, the custodian of his administration\'s White House records. President Joe Biden has diverged from Trump\'s claims and decided the Archives should hand over the documents.""What sets this case apart is the undisputed fact that, under the Presidential Records Act, President Biden has no authority to disclose President Trump\'s records on his own, just as under the Constitution, Congress has no authority to compel the production of the privileged material,"" said Meadows\' amicus brief, from his legal team at the law firm McGuireWoods. ""Unless the Court steps in to say otherwise, Presidential advisors will henceforth need to assume that it only takes a party-change in the Presidency and a sympathetic Committee Chairman in Congress to compel disclosure of their advice and other Presidential communications.""Meadows\' brief also dings the House committee for its members who have publicly discussed the possibility of criminal referrals emerging from their probe. Read More""Unless this Court steps in, the Select Committee\'s investigation will represent the greatest expansion of Congress\'s power to investigate and target private citizens since the days of the House Un-American Activities Committee,"" wrote the team defending Meadows, who is a former Republican member of Congress.The federal appeals court in DC that ruled against Trump in December signed off on the legitimacy of the House probe.Meadows also told the Supreme Court that he believes it should hear Trump\'s case because it has implications for several witnesses the House committee has subpoenaed for documents.Meadows and more than a dozen others have sued separately to challenge the committee, and those cases are in their earliest stages before trial-level judges. Meadows said in his case that if he answered any question the committee asked him or turned over all documents its members want, he could be revealing information Trump is trying to keep secret.""Former officials are thus left to navigate conflicting instructions from the incumbent President and the former President under whom they served. If they follow President Biden\'s direction and provide privileged testimony to Congress, they effectively moot President Trump\'s assertion of Executive Privilege— as well as this Court\'s opportunity to clarify waiver of privilege held by former Presidents,"" Meadows\' lawyers wrote. ""If they follow President Trump\'s direction and defy a subpoena without first seeking judicial recourse (as [Meadows] has), they face the prospect of prosecution.""The House has asked the Justice Department to prosecute Meadows for contempt of Congress for failing to testify, but he has not been charged.The House also wants the Supreme Court to look at Trump\'s requests in the case quickly. The committee is working toward a goal of releasing an interim report with initial findings by the summer.By keeping the executive privilege questions in court, Trump has so far delayed the release of documents and chilled witnesses responding to the House\'s subpoenas since the fall.', 'Appeals court sees little urgency in speeding up challenge to Texas abortion ban after contentious hearingBy Tierney Sneed, CNNUpdated 6:45 PM ET, Fri January 7, 2022 JUST WATCHEDSupreme Court upholds TX abortion law, but says providers can sue ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSupreme Court upholds TX abortion law, but says providers can sue  02:28 (CNN)In a tense hearing Friday, the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals signaled that -- for now -- it was likely to keep the Texas abortion case out of the hands of a federal judge who in the past had blocked the state\'s six-week ban on abortion. The 5th Circuit panel is deciding what should come next in abortion clinics\' federal lawsuit challenging the ban after the Supreme Court kept the case alive in a decision handed down last month. ""Maybe we should just sit on this until the end of June,"" Judge Edith Jones said Friday, citing a separate challenge to Roe v. Wade already at the high court.""By that time, it is very possible the hot potato will be in the seat of the Supreme Court,"" she added. The clinics say the case should be sent to US District Court Judge Robert Pitman, who blocked the law last October in a separate case brought by the Justice Department, only for that order to be frozen by the 5th Circuit. Read MoreThe providers\' request got no apparent traction with two of the three judges on the appellate panel. The third judge -- the panel\'s sole Democratic appointee -- had already said he would grant the request in a dissent that decried the ""impermissible delay to the vindication of the constitutional rights of Texas women in federal court."" Instead, the appellate panel\'s Republican-appointed majority seems poised to grant a request from Texas and the ban\'s other legal defenders to send the case to the Texas Supreme Court. The defenders say that, before the federal lawsuit moves any further, the Texas Supreme Court needs to weigh in on state law questions that they say were left unresolved by the US Supreme Court\'s decision last month. Jones, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, appeared to agree. She warned that the federal courts are ""all going to have egg on our faces"" if the Texas State Supreme Court interpreted the state law in a way that was at odds with how the federal judges were approaching the case. She also floated the idea that the 5th Circuit could just sit on the case until the US Supreme Court handed down its decision in a separate abortion case it heard last month, where the conservative justices may make significant changes to the court precedent that protects abortion rights. Circuit Judge Kyle Duncan, an appointee of President Donald Trump, meanwhile questioned whether there was really any urgency in moving the federal lawsuit along, given the ways the US Supreme Court had already scaled back the clinics\' case.Four months and counting that most abortions have been illegal in Texas The legal issues before the 5th Circuit are extremely technical. But at stake is whether abortion providers will have any shot in the coming months to get an order that would at least partially block enforcement of the law.  The clinics have already asked the Supreme Court to intervene yet again in the 5th Circuit\'s handling of the case. So far, the justices have not taken any action on that request, which was filed Monday night. The year Supreme Court conservatives made their mark  For more than four months, a law that bans a majority of abortions in the country\'s second most populous state has been in effect. Given the legal risks that come with violating the ban, which outlaws abortions when fetal cardiac activity is detected, clinics have been unwilling to offer the procedure in those instances -- a point around six weeks into the pregnancy, before many women even realize they\'re pregnant. So far, the Texas ban\'s unique enforcement mechanism has allowed it to stand in the face of Supreme Court precedent that protects abortion rights before a fetus is viable -- a point around 23 weeks into the pregnancy when the fetus can survive outside the womb. Rather than impose criminal or administrative penalties for clinics that conduct abortions after six weeks, the Texas law allows private citizens to sue those providers -- or anyone else who assists the person obtaining the abortion -- in state court, with the threat of damages of at least $10,000.When the US Supreme Court reviewed the case last year, it said the clinics could not get federal court orders preemptively blocking state court officials from accepting those lawsuits. But eight of the justices said their lawsuit could proceed against a select group of state licensing who could in theory revoke providers\' medical licenses for violating the six-week ban. On Friday, comments from Duncan illuminated why the Supreme Court decision had left clinics with little hope for effective relief in federal court from the law, known as SB8. ""The principal injury that you\'re seeking to redress here is the threat of SB8 lawsuits puts a chill on your clients\' provision of abortion services, right?"" Duncan told Marc Hearron, a senior counsel for the Center for Reproductive Rights who is representing the providers.""So how would an injunction against these licensing officials redress that at all?"" Duncan asked, later adding that, given that reality, he was struggling to see the urgency of moving the federal lawsuit along quickly. A clock ticking on a separate Supreme Court case that could bolster Texas\' ban In the background of these procedural maneuverings is an even bigger threat to abortion rights not just in Texas -- but nationwide. Gorsuch deals abortion providers another setback by sending Texas SB8 lawsuit to a conservative appeals courtThe Supreme Court last month heard a separate abortion case out of Mississippi that gives the conservative majority the opportunity to gut -- and perhaps, outright reverse -- current precedent protecting pre-viability abortions.The idea of waiting until a summer ruling on the Mississippi case and Roe v. Wade drew vehement pushback from the clinics\' attorney, who called it ""completely inconsistent"" with how quickly the Supreme Court handled had the Texas case so far. Even the attorney for Texas, Assistant Solicitor General Natalie Thompson acknowledged that Texas is not asking for that delay, under persistent grilling from Judge Stephen Higginson, who was appointed by President Barack Obama. Nerves were frayed among the judges as the 45-minute hearing wore on. Not only did the Republican-appointed judges express repeated dissatisfaction with how Hearron, the clinics\' attorney, was handling their questions, they exchanged shots with Higginson. Jones interjected in one line of tough questions Higginson had for Texas\' attorney: ""Normally this court isn\'t litigating on behalf of on one side or the other,"" Jones said.Higginson asked Thompson, the Texas attorney, if there had be any unfair question to her. She said no and he continued with his questions.', 'What the Carlson-Cruz exchange reveals about today\'s GOPOpinion by Julian Zelizer, CNN Political AnalystUpdated 4:13 PM ET, Fri January 7, 2022 JUST WATCHEDFox host spars with Ted Cruz on live TV over Jan. 6th.

Follow him on Twitter @julianzelizer. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN)Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz got himself into some trouble with one of the party bosses at Fox News this week.   January 6 was a test the US keeps failing The problem began on Wednesday, when, in a US Senate hearing, Cruz said that the nation was approaching ""an anniversary of a violent terrorist attack on the Capitol where we saw the men and women of law enforcement demonstrate incredible courage, incredible bravery, risk their lives to defend the men and women who service in this Capitol."" The choice of using the word ""terrorist"" echoed remarks that he\'d made in the past -- including on January 7, 2021, a day after the attack. Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host who has gone out of his way to downplay and distort the terrible events of that day, was less than pleased. He reprimanded Cruz on Thursday night -- and, in doing so, sent a clear message: in today\'s Republican Party, he -- not Cruz -- has all the power.Read MoreCarlson started his segment by accusing Cruz of lying for referring to January 6 as a ""violent terrorist attack."" Cruz didn\'t take long to backtrack, saying to Carlson in an interview on Fox News: ""The way I phrased things yesterday -- it was sloppy, and it was, frankly, dumb.""  When Carlson refused to accept the apology, a groveling Cruz said he was just talking about a ""limited number"" of people who assaulted police officers -- not the ""thousands of peaceful protesters"" supporting former President Donald Trump.   But Carlson was having none of it. ""I guess I just don\'t believe you,"" he remarked. The Fox News host then said that Cruz, a former trial lawyer, has always chosen words carefully and was providing fodder to Trump\'s critics by branding his supporters in such a negative light. Ted Cruz told the truth about the 1/6 attack. Then he started backtracking. Of course, the rumble made for good television -- a prominent right-wing pundit taking on a prominent right-wing legislator, who had himself been a leading voice in the campaign to challenge the legitimacy of the election. In many ways, the moment had the feel of a revolution swallowing one of its own. The politician who has stood right by the former President and the party\'s assault on the electoral system was now being accused of helping the opposition.  But the interaction was also an important reminder of the immense power that the conservative media ecosystem holds on the party -- and more specifically that Fox News maintains in shaping the tone and the agenda of the GOP. When any Republican legislator dares to step out of line, the network\'s hosts are ready to push back and make clear there is a cost to be paid for taking even the slightest political detour.  And their ire isn\'t limited to Cruz. When Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger criticized Trump for challenging the 2020 presidential election results, Fox News host Mark Levin tweeted that he was ""a devious and reckless"" politician. In recent months, those sorts of attacks have only intensified against Kinzinger, who has become a prominent member of the House select committee investigating the events around January 6. Beyond exemplifying the power of right-wing media, Carlson\'s exchange with Cruz also provides clear evidence that the radicalized state of the GOP cannot all be attributed to Trump. Though there is an inclination among many Democrats -- including President Joe Biden -- to focus their criticism on Trump, the reality is far more complex.Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion\'s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook Trump\'s emergence on the political scene is a consequence of the Republican Party\'s sharp turn rightward -- both in terms of its policies and tactics over the last several decades. From the smash-mouth partisanship of legislators like Newt Gingrich in the 1990s, to the growth of conservative media in recent years, Republican politics helped set the stage for Trumpism before they became one and the same. And if any Republican politician feels that there is any leeway to deviate from the party line now that Trump is no longer in office, he or she should re-watch the Carlson-Cruz segment. The forces of an extremist GOP remain as strong as ever -- and regardless of whether Trump decides to run again in 2024, the kind of radical Republicanism that he has championed will continue to endure.  Among many others, we can thank Tucker Carlson for that. ', '', 'GOP banking on Ron Johnson run in crucial Senate race By Alex Rogers and Manu Raju, CNNUpdated 3:34 PM ET, Fri January 7, 2022 JUST WATCHEDHow GOP\'s Ron Johnson evolved into conspiracy promoterReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow GOP\'s Ron Johnson evolved into conspiracy promoter 07:09 (CNN)Republicans are growing bullish that Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson will soon launch his reelection campaign in 2022, setting the stage for a bruising race that could determine control of the Senate and whether former President Donald Trump will continue to have one of his staunchest allies in the chamber. Johnson has been in no rush to publicly announce his decision, often saying that Senate campaigns are far too long and pointing out that he waited until May 2010 to announce his first bid for an election later that fall. And in interviews this week, Johnson refused to tip his hand about which way he was leaning. ""I\'m not ready to say anything,"" Johnson told CNN. Asked if he is planning on making his announcement next week, the senator replied, ""I do all kinds of events.""One GOP source said an announcement could come as soon as next week.In private conversations, Republicans are coming away with the distinct impression that Johnson will run again, according to multiple GOP sources, and would be surprised if he did not. Some Republicans have grown impatient of waiting, as potential candidates decline to make a decision about their political futures until he makes his.  Read MoreWhen asked if he wants Johnson to run this fall, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said, ""Of course I do.""Republicans, including Trump himself, have been urging Johnson to run again, even though Johnson said in 2016 that he wouldn\'t seek a third term. In November, he said that he\'d prefer to ""go home"" but was ""panicked"" about the direction of the country and unsure whether he could ""give up the fight."" ""I fully expect to see Sen. Johnson run for reelection,"" said Andrew Hitt, a former Wisconsin Republican party chairman. ""He\'s continued to travel the state. He\'s been very active. All signs really point to him getting in the race very soon."" South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Republican in the chamber, is also expected to make a major decision about whether he\'ll run again in the coming days. But unlike Thune, who serves a reliably red state, Johnson knows that his choice will alter the race for one of the Democratic Party\'s few pick-up opportunities in 2022.Officials in both parties have said they want Johnson, the only Wisconsin Republican holding statewide office, to mount a reelection bid. Sen. Ron Johnson answers questions from reporters in February 2021 in Washington, DC. Even though they have other potential Republican candidates who may lack Johnson\'s liabilities and could potentially appeal to more middle-of-the-road voters, some Republicans still believe that Johnson gives them their best chance to hold the seat. Democrats say the senator is uniquely vulnerable after a string of controversial and misleading comments regarding coronavirus and the January 6 attack on the Capitol.Florida Sen. Rick Scott, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said of Johnson that ""I\'ve always believed he\'s going to run."" And he made clear he\'d like that announcement to come soon. ""Everybody that\'s going to run, I\'d like them to announce,"" Scott said. ""In this job, I\'d rather get people to announce."" The US Senate race in Wisconsin will be one of the most hotly contested of the year, no matter if Johnson runs or not. The six Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 are currently held by three Democrats in Nevada, Georgia and Arizona and three Republicans in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Biden narrowly won five of those states in 2020 and narrowly lost the sixth, North Carolina, but a backlash against his presidency has left Republicans optimistic that they will take back the Senate in 2022. Democrats currently control the 50-50 Senate with the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Kamala Harris.Johnson is the only senator to campaign in 2022 in a state carried by the opposite party\'s 2020 presidential candidate. Biden beat Trump by less than one percentage point -- about 21,000 votes -- in Wisconsin. Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, Wisconsin Treasurer Sarah Godlewski, Alex Lasry, an executive with the Milwaukee Bucks and son of the franchise\'s billionaire co-owner, local county executive Tom Nelson, radiologist Gillian Battino and others are running in the Senate Democratic primary. The Democrats have attacked Johnson for misleading the public on the Covid-19 vaccine, downplaying the January 6 attack and dismissing climate change.Johnson has questioned the safety of the Covid-19 vaccines, while his office has maintained that he is pro-vaccine, and touted the benefits of alternative drugs like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin that federal health officials say have not been proven effective in treating the virus. ""The misinformation and disinformation that he continues to espouse is dangerous,"" Sen. Tammy Baldwin, the Democrat from Wisconsin, told CNN. ""And so I do think that has an impact on the race."" Only 38% of Wisconsin registered voters surveyed in an October 2021 Marquette Law School poll said they would probably or definitely vote to reelect Johnson.  Hitt acknowledged that Johnson faced ""headwinds"" but expected that he would overcome them to beat whoever emerges from the Democratic primary. ""When Sen. Johnson turns on the campaign and sets his mind to it, and goes out there, day in and day out, explaining to Wisconsinites what he has done, what he believes and what he\'s going to do for them, he is a force to be reckoned with,"" Hitt said. ""I fully expect that he will continue to be our senator."" In 2016, conservative groups left Johnson for dead, doubting that he could beat former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold. Johnson, a former Oshkosh plastics manufacturing company owner, won by three points. ""Sen. Johnson has proven to be one of the most effective campaigners in Wisconsin history -- winning when most people thought he didn\'t have a chance,"" said veteran Wisconsin GOP strategist Mark Graul. But Democrats believe that Johnson will suffer due to his strong support of Trump, even though polls show Republicans benefiting in 2022 due to Biden\'s low approval ratings.In 2019, the Democratic-controlled House impeached Trump for pressuring Ukraine to announce politically damaging investigations of Biden and his son Hunter, while using military aid and a White House meeting coveted by Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky as leverage.  After the Republican-led Senate acquitted Trump in 2020, Johnson used his position as chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee to investigate Biden and his son Hunter\'s foreign financial dealings in Ukraine. The panel did not conclude that Biden altered US policy to benefit his son. And Johnson has continued to try and shift blame from Trump for the violence of January 6, 2021, suggesting that a small group of provocateurs may have been responsible for turning a largely peaceful protest of the 2020 election into a rampage that left five dead and about 140 police officers injured.  Johnson has also pushed back on those who said the riot was an ""armed"" insurrection, saying the FBI was unaware of any arms being confiscated or any shots fired besides from law enforcement, even though the Justice Department has said that more than 75 people have been charged with carrying a dangerous or deadly weapon or ""causing serious bodily injury to an officer"" that day.Johnson has condemned the violence and acknowledged that other weapons besides firearms were used by the rioters.  But in an interview last year with CNN, Johnson aligned himself with Trump, questioning the legitimacy of the 2020 election.""I think there are some real issues that have not been answered and I think these are legitimate concerns about the election,"" Johnson said. ""I\'m not afraid of the truth, OK?"" If Johnson ultimately decides not to run, Republicans would scramble to campaign for the seat. One potential candidate is Wisconsin Rep. Mike Gallagher, although he declined to address the speculation in a brief interview.""I\'m only thinking about my current term in Congress and defeating the Chinese Communist Party,"" Gallagher said. ""That\'s what consumes my every waking moment.""This story has been updated with additional developments Friday.CNN\'s Ted Barrett and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.', '', 'Republicans are down to four finalist cities for 2024 conventionBy Dan Merica, CNNUpdated 2:28 PM ET, Fri January 7, 2022 US President Donald Trump delivers his acceptance speech for the Republican Party nomination for reelection during the final day of the Republican National Convention from the South Lawn of the White House on August 27, 2020 in Washington, DC.Washington (CNN)Republicans have selected the four potential host cities for their 2024 convention, according to a spokesperson for the Republican National Committee.The cities are Milwaukee, Nashville, Pittsburgh and Salt Lake City, the spokesperson said.Committee staff will now travel to each city to determine the viability of each convention and will then narrow the selection process down to three cities, a committee spokesperson said. The RNC\'s Site Selection Committee will then travel to the final three cities to further determine the feasibility of a large-scale event, including space for the convention events, hotels, ease of travel and breadth of corporate sponsorships, the spokesperson said.Where a political party hosts its national convention is widely seen as a symbolic choice that offers the party a chance to both build infrastructure in a key swing state and message to important subsets of voters. Most conventions have been held in swing states over the last three decades, but some political operatives from each party believe the significance of a convention site is often overstated.Politico was the first to report that the Republican list is down to four cities.Read MoreIn 2020, Republicans held some official convention events in Charlotte, North Carolina, their original host city, despite the city stopping the full-scale event due to the coronavirus pandemic. Many of the primetime addresses were delivered from Washington, DC.Meanwhile, Democrats chose to largely scrap all events in Milwaukee, the city they had selected to host the event that year, and moved the events to a virtual setting or from a stage near then-candidate Joe Biden\'s home in Wilmington, Delaware.By selecting either Pittsburgh or Milwaukee, Republicans would be centering their 2024 messaging in major cities within key swing states. Biden narrowly defeated former President Donald Trump in both Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in 2020. Both states also will feature high-profile Senate races in 2022 and will likely once again be key presidential battlegrounds in 2024. Nashville and Salt Lake City are both in states that have backed Republican presidents for decades.""The Republican National Committee is grateful for and appreciative of the overwhelming interest from cities across the country to host the 2024 Republican National Convention. We\'ll continue the process, review bids, and communicate with potential hosts to hear more about what their cities have to offer,"" RNC chief of staff Richard Walters said.The Democratic National Committee is also working to select their 2024 convention host. Chair Jaime Harrison asked cities interested in hosting their convention to submit their bids by October 2021, but a committee spokesperson declined to say if the committee had finalists.']","['Harry Reid, a longtime US senator from Nevada and former Democratic leader, dies at 82  By Dan Merica and Paul LeBlanc, CNNUpdated 10:54 PM ET, Tue December 28, 2021 JUST WATCHEDA look back at the life and legacy of Harry ReidReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH (17 Videos)A look back at the life and legacy of Harry ReidEx-Ted Cruz aide: Media focusing on wrong part of Fox interviewPolitico apologizes for their story about this photoThis governor tells businesses in his state not to comply with the vaccine mandateTapper presses NYC mayor on appointing his brother as NYPD officialReporter explains why McConnell isn\'t talking about TrumpFormer aide on whether Pence will speak to Jan. 6 committeeBiden tears into Trump during January 6th speechEx-Trump aide describes the worry with Trump\'s \'fragile ego\'See Jake Tapper\'s plea to RepublicansLawmaker shares a \'defining memory\' from the January 6th insurrectionHonig: This shows NY AG is broadening her Trump investigationPediatrician to FL governor: \'Listen to science\' now more than everCNN commentator calls out AOC\'s \'creepy weirdos\' tweetWhat to expect on the first anniversary of the January 6th Capitol riotTwitter suspends Marjorie Taylor Greene account over Covid-19 misinformationCheney: Trump sat in White House watching Capitol attack on TV (CNN)Harry Reid, the scrappy former Democratic Senate leader who spearheaded epic legislative battles through three decades in Congress, has died at the age of 82, according to a statement from his wife, Landra Reid.""I am heartbroken to announce the passing of my husband, former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. He died peacefully this afternoon, surrounded by our family, following a courageous, four-year battle with pancreatic cancer,"" she said in a statement Tuesday.Reid rose from humble beginnings in Searchlight, Nevada, to become the most powerful politician in Nevada history, capping off his political career as the Democratic leader in the Senate, including eight years in the majority.  President Joe Biden, who served with Reid in the Senate, called him one of ""the all-time great Senate Majority Leaders in our history"" in a statement Tuesday. ""He was my leader, my mentor, one of my dearest friends,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a statement Tuesday evening. ""He\'s gone but he will walk by the sides of many of us in the Senate every single day.""Read MoreFormer President Barack Obama released a letter he had written to Reid before his death in lieu of a statement. ""I wouldn\'t have been president had it not been for your encouragement and support, and I wouldn\'t have got most of what I got done without your skill and determination,"" Obama wrote. Reid underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer in 2018 and said less than a year later that he was in remission. At the time, he told CNN\'s Dana Bash that he felt ""very good"" and that he was ""doing fine."" But Reid responded to his cancer diagnosis with his usual bluntness, telling The New York Times in 2019: ""As soon as you discover you have something on your pancreas, you\'re dead."" From modest beginnings to the US Senate The beginning of Reid\'s life didn\'t hint at his political future. Born in 1939 in a modest home with no running water, his mother once earned money by doing laundry for local brothels, he wrote in his memoir, ""The Good Fight,"" while his father worked as a hard-rock miner. He attended high school in Henderson, Nevada, often hitchhiking the 45-mile route. A boxer in his youth, Reid later attended Utah State University before moving to Washington, DC, and working his way through law school at George Washington University by working as an officer for the United States Capitol Police. ""I think I am the only former Capitol policeman here that is a senator,"" Reid said in 2011. ""I have such great respect for the work that they do.""  Photos: Former US Sen.

Harry ReidReid acknowledges the audience during a Nevada Democrats event in Las Vegas in 2019. A year earlier, he underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer.Hide Caption 33 of 33After law school, Reid returned to Nevada and served as lieutenant governor from 1971 to 1975, the youngest person elected to that role in the state. After losing reelection, Reid served as chair of the Nevada Gaming Commission, a powerful position that oversees and regulates the state\'s casino industry. The job made Reid and his family a target of the mob: After he left that post, his wife found a bomb in the family\'s car, Reid wrote in his memoir. Reid\'s political career grew with Nevada. When the state went from one congressional district to two after the 1980 census, Reid ran for a newly created congressional district around Las Vegas in 1982 and won the general election. He was reelected in 1984. He then successfully ran for Nevada\'s open Senate seat in 1986.  He rose through the leadership ranks there, serving as the chamber\'s Democratic whip from 1999 to 2005. From 2005 through his retirement in 2017, he served as his party\'s leader in the Senate, through Democrats\' time in both the minority and the majority. Playing politics  As the chamber\'s Democratic leader, Reid was a polarizing figure. Republicans argued much of the congressional gridlock stemmed from his hard-ball tactics, but Reid often reveled in playing the political bad guy -- even calling then-President George W. Bush a ""loser"" and a ""liar."" (Later, when Donald Trump was in the White House, Reid told CNN\'s Bash that he wished for Bush ""every day."") Reid is often blamed for deepening an era of political polarization with irascible rhetoric about Republicans and the use of controversial Senate procedures that left traditionalists worried that the consensus that once made the chamber special had vanished forever.  He brought those same tactics to electoral politics, too. During Obama\'s reelection bid in 2012, Reid accused Republican nominee Mitt Romney, with no evidence, of not paying his taxes. Asked by CNN in 2015 whether he regretted the attack, Reid said, ""I don\'t regret that at all."" ""Romney didn\'t win, did he?"" Reid asked rhetorically. As much as he irked Republicans, he was often cheered by Democrats for being the last line of defense to Bush and other Republicans. He was a staunch defender of social programs and, reflecting wishes of the large Latino community back home, a proponent of immigration reform.  Reid shepherded the centerpieces of Obama\'s liberal political legacy into law, and he said one of his proudest accomplishments had been encouraging then-Sen. Obama to run for president.  ""I did call him into my office and told him he should take a look at it. And he was stunned because I was the first one that ever suggested that to him,"" Reid told CNN in 2015.  ""When he was reelected, (that was) one of the most moving phone calls I\'ve ever received because he said, you know, \'You\'re the reason I\'m here,\'"" Reid recalled. Obama reiterated that sentiment in the letter he sent to Reid released Tuesday evening. ""Here\'s what I want you to know. You were a great leader in the Senate, and early on you were more generous to me than I had any right to expect,"" Obama wrote.""As different as we are, I think we both saw something of ourselves in each other - a couple of outsiders who had defied the odds and knew how to take a punch and cared about the little guy. And you know what, we made for a pretty good team,"" he added.Former President Bill Clinton also lauded Reid, remembering him as ""one of the most effective Senate leaders our country has ever known.""""We will likely never see another public servant quite like him—in personality, command of strategy and tactics, and assuredness in marching to the beat of his own drum,"" Clinton said in a statement.In the darkest hours of the Great Recession, Reid ushered a nearly $800 billion economic stimulus plan through the Senate despite insurmountable rows with most Republicans, who said it was too expensive and racked up too much debt.  Later, he piloted the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, through the Senate using a controversial budget maneuver known as reconciliation to bypass a Republican filibuster, and he told the GOP to ""stop crying"" about it.  ""Senator Harry Reid was a leader of immense courage and ferocious conviction who worked tirelessly to achieve historic progress for the American people,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who, as the House\'s top Democrat for the last 20 years, worked with Reid across the Capitol. ""Over more than four decades of public service, Senator Reid was guided always by his North Star: to improve the lives of working families like his own,"" she added in a statement reflecting on his death. In modern-day Washington, the former senator\'s impact is perhaps most present in his 2013 change to the Senate rules to prevent filibusters of most executive branch nominations. He told CNN last year that he ""absolutely"" doesn\'t regret changing the rules at the time, saying: ""I have no regret. It was the right thing to do. And by the way, it\'s not the first time the rules have been changed. They\'ve been changed lots of times. It was time to do it again.""  Broad use of the filibuster has soared in recent years in an increasingly polarized Congress. The shift prompted Reid to pen an opinion piece in the New York Times in 2019 calling for an end to the filibuster altogether.  ""During the two decades we served together in the United States Senate, and the eight years we worked together while I served as Vice President, Harry met the marker for what I\'ve always believed is the most important thing by which you can measure a person—their action and their word,"" Biden said in his Tuesday statement.""If Harry said he would do something, he did it. If he gave you his word, you could bank on it. That\'s how he got things done for the good of the country for decades,"" the President added.Despite his blunt political style, Reid inspired fierce respect from many of his longtime aides, as well as fellow lawmakers -- even those across the aisle.  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who was frequently at odds with Reid during their lengthy careers, remembered him as a ""one-of-a-kind"" senator, saying their relationship had transcended political fights.""The nature of Harry\'s and my jobs brought us into frequent and sometimes intense conflict over politics and policy. But I never doubted that Harry was always doing what he earnestly, deeply felt was right for Nevada and our country,"" the Kentucky Republican said. ""He will rightly go down in history as a crucial, pivotal figure in the development and history of his beloved home state.""Reid told CNN earlier this year that he has ""a lot of respect"" for John Boehner, the former Republican House speaker from Ohio with whom he sparred for years, as he reacted to excerpts of Boehner\'s memoir and lambasted the Republican Party\'s more recent ""tribal"" turn.   ""The deal is this. John Boehner and I got a lot done, but we didn\'t mince words,"" he said.  Love and legacy Despite Reid\'s reputation as a hard bargainer with no qualms about scrapping with his opponents, he was also known as a romantic and the most influential person in his life was his wife, Landra. The two met in high school when Reid was 15. Her father was so opposed to the two dating that Reid and his would-be father-in-law got into a fist fight early in their courtship. Reid, who was raised agnostic, told Bash in 2015 that their opposition was that they wanted their daughter to marry someone Jewish. They eloped in 1959 during college, converting to Mormonism a year later. Her parents finally came around on him. ""I am a blessed man to have this 5-foot tall woman with me all these years,"" said Reid.  The former Senate majority leader credited one thing for his political success over the years: Hard work.  ""I didn\'t make it in life because of my athletic prowess. I didn\'t make it because of my good looks. I didn\'t make it because I\'m a genius,"" he said in his farewell address on the Senate floor in 2016. ""I made it because I worked hard.""  Reid\'s most lasting legacy is likely to be felt in Nevada, where the senator not only remade the Western state, but turned it into a Democratic stronghold that last backed a Republican president in 2004.  ""The little boy from Searchlight has been able to be part of a changing state of Nevada,"" he said in his farewell address in 2016. Reid was instrumental in pushing Democrats to make Nevada one of the first nominating contests in the country, a move that focused Democratic attention on Nevada and was a catalyst to its leftward shift. He often pushed Democrats to make Nevada even more important, urging the party, because of the state\'s diversity, to move the state before Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states in the nominating process. He also used his power to lift up the careers of younger politicians, like Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, whom the former Senate majority leader recruited to run for his seat when he was retiring in 2016.""Harry Reid was a champion for Nevada, helping preserve our precious environmental treasures, strengthen our rural communities, and build up our great cities,"" Cortez Masto recalled in a statement on Tuesday. ""The American people are better off because of the leadership of Senator Harry Reid.""In recognition of the impact Reid had on Nevada, the Clark County Board of Commissioners voted earlier this year in favor of renaming McCarran International Airport to Harry Reid International Airport. Reid reflected on his life -- and the role he played in changing Nevada -- when he received a lifetime achievement award from the Nevada Democratic Party in 2019. ""It\'s a long way from Searchlight to Washington,"" he said. ""But I didn\'t get there alone. I got there because of you, Nevadans."" This story has been updated with additional information.

A pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol that day, breaking windows and clashing with police officers. Trump supporters had gathered to protest the ratification of Joe Biden\'s Electoral College victory. (CNN)America\'s running political conversation defaults to the sitting president. Today, Joe Biden\'s legislative struggles, pandemic management and weak approval rating drown out most everything else. But in 2021, the performance of his partisan adversaries mattered at least as much to the nation\'s future. And in Washington and state capitals alike, Republicans have compiled a record of dishonesty and aggression that threatens American democracy itself.The January 6 insurrection, incited by then-President Donald Trump to overturn his election defeat, offered them a different path. Deadly violence that endangered their own lives gave Republican lawmakers the strongest possible justification for separating themselves from Trump\'s disfiguring pathologies.For a moment, they did. Shaken congressional leaders condemned him and returned to the vandalized capital to affirm Biden\'s victory.The moment passed.Read MoreState legislators gear up to pass a \'tidal wave\' of voting restrictions ahead of crucial 2022 midtermsThose same Republican leaders later scuttled a proposed bipartisan investigation. GOP legislators in battleground states curbed voting procedures and changed election administration to help future losers succeed where Trump had failed in thwarting the popular will. ""Until recently, when I got up in the morning it didn\'t occur to me that American democracy might be in the balance,"" observed Richard Haass, a high-ranking national security aide to two Republican administrations who has quit the GOP. ""It\'s no longer a given. I don\'t think it\'s melodramatic to say this is the greatest crisis we\'ve faced since the 19th century.""Narrowly, the crisis stems from Trump\'s 2016 rise on false promises to the minority of voters most aggrieved by the cultural and economic changes reshaping 21st-century America. But its roots extend back to the decades-old Republican strategy of harvesting support from conservative White opponents of the 1960s civil rights revolution.Those voters -- disproportionately Southern, less educated, rural, evangelical -- now represent the white-hot core of the Trump-era GOP.Analysis: There\'s nothing more frightening in America today than an angry White man""When you think about the DNA of the current Republican Party being built around racial resentment, it\'s only one small step,"" said Robert P. Jones, an opinion analyst who\'s the CEO and founder of Public Religion Research Institute. ""The very idea that some citizens ought to have a privileged place in the eyes of the law is, at its heart, anti-democratic.""Unlike earlier Republican campaigns, Trump barely masked his race-based appeals. He consistently stoked anxiety over lost power and primacy among the shrinking ranks of White conservative Christians.""Having alienated college-educated suburban voters, many consequential Republicans decided their best bet is to keep their contracting coalition in a state of constant agitation and fear, combatants in a never-ending culture war,"" Peter Wehner, a former aide to President George W. Bush, wrote earlier this year. ""Right now, the Republican Party is a grave threat to American democracy.""Trump has long expressed admiration for authoritarian strongmen. Fox News star Tucker Carlson in August staged his program in Hungary, the east European nation scholars call an exemplar of eroding democracy.Analysis: Why it\'s now \'American identity, stupid\' in US politics""There are two key metrics: how do they deal with violence, and do they accept election results,"" said Harvard professor Daniel Ziblatt, co-author of the book ""How Democracies Die."" On both counts, Republicans have crept toward authoritarianism.Trump and elected allies turned to praising the January 6 mob and minimizing its lawless violence; some brandish guns on social media or in campaign ads. One congressman circulated a photoshopped anime video that appeared to depict the murder of a Democratic colleague. (He later said he doesn\'t ""espouse violence or harm towards any member of Congress"" and that the video ""symbolizes the battle for the soul of America."")In a recent Public Religion Research Institute survey, 30% of Republicans agreed that ""true American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country."" In a differently worded American Enterprise Institute poll question last January, 60% of White evangelical Christians agreed that ""The traditional American way of life is disappearing so fast that we may have to use force to save it.""Egged on by Trump, leading Republicans have made affirming or acquiescing in his big lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him a threshold qualification. In the 2022 GOP primary race for Georgia governor, ex-Sen. David Perdue distinguishes himself from incumbent Brian Kemp by saying he would not have certified Biden\'s 2020 Georgia win.Deteriorating political conditions for Democrats have positioned Republicans to win control of Congress next year without extra help. But having lost the popular vote in seven of the last eight presidential elections, they\'re not taking chances.Vilified by Trump, Liz Cheney explores her political future with backing from GOP eldersA cadre of anti-Trump Republicans see glimpses of hope in their effort to change the party from within. Barbara Comstock, a former House member and congressional staffer, cites the Virginia gubernatorial victory in November of private-equity executive Glenn Youngkin, who accepted Trump\'s endorsement but eschewed his raw tactics.""Has it been a discouraging year? Yes,"" Comstock allowed. ""But I do feel new leaders will step up.""""It\'s important to wrench the party back to its senses,"" added Kori Schake, a former Bush aide who directs foreign policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. ""I do think it\'s possible. I\'m still a Republican, standing squarely behind Liz Cheney.""Invoking the Wyoming Republican congresswoman, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, only underscores the enormousness of the challenge. House Republicans ousted her as conference chair after she emphatically rejected Trump\'s election lies. She and Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois have become lone voices seeking to hold Trump and insurrectionist allies accountable and affirm America\'s 245-year-old democratic experiment.""How we address January 6 is the moral test of our generation,"" Cheney declared recently. In 2021, her party failed it.', 'Finding a Covid-19 test is a struggle right now in the US as Omicron and holiday plans collideBy Aya Elamroussi, CNNUpdated 3:23 AM ET, Thu December 23, 2021 JUST WATCHEDFauci weighs in on risk of indoor holiday gatherings ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH (16 Videos)Fauci weighs in on risk of indoor holiday gatherings \'The surge isn\'t going to last forever\': Doctor reassures parents sending kids back to schoolNew York City\'s mayor: School is the \'safest place\' despite rising Covid casesLargest pediatric hospital sees 4x increase in hospitalizationsKyrie Irving explains why he \'respected\' team\'s decision to bench himWoman isolates in plane bathroom after testing positive for Covid-19Source: FDA expected to approve Pfizer boosters for 12 to 15-year-oldsDr. Fauci explains why CDC changed Covid-19 isolation guidelinesOmicron derails holiday plans, strains hospitalsDoctor explains how to tell the difference between Covid-19 and a coldFauci says officials are considering shorter isolation periodsCruise ships face Omicron outbreaks at seaDoctor describes getting death threats from families of Covid patients\'I hope he keeps it up\': Hear Fauci\'s praise for Trump\'Help\': Cleveland-area hospitals put ad in local newspaper Economist predicts how Omicron will impact the economy (CNN)With coronavirus cases surging once again, frustrated Americans are struggling to get tested days before Christmas as long lines and increased demand overwhelm some facilities across the country.The catalyst has been the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, which has become the dominant strain in the US in a matter of weeks and has led to a slew of new measures to combat the spread.Omicron will not recognize state lines when it storms the US, expert saysWith millions traveling or planning to join large family gatherings, there is a rush to get tested -- and many people are running out of luck, either with getting tests at clinics or with buying at-home test kits.Long lines were seen this week in New York City, Boston and Miami, as well as Ohio and Minnesota. At the same time, CVS Health and Walgreens -- the two largest pharmaceutical chain stores in the US -- are limiting the number of at-home Covid kits customers can buy due to significant demand, they announced.Read MoreThe demand is only going to grow, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. ""We do have some testing. But what we\'re going to need, I think, over the course of the next two to eight weeks is going to be remarkable. We are going to see this big surge nationwide,"" he predicted.And while the Biden administration plans to provide 500 million new tests by next month, the holiday test surge is happening now. A former assistant secretary of the US Health and Human Services Department is concerned the co pledge on tests will not meet the demand, he said. ""Unless we have a billion or 2 billion a month, I think we\'re still going to have to be selective to make sure that we keep people who can die from the disease from dying from the disease,"" Adm. Dr. Brett Giroir told CNN.FDA authorizes first pill to treat Covid-19While experts urge more test availability, physicians are getting another tool to fight Covid-19: The US Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday authorized Pfizer\'s antiviral pill, Paxlovid, to treat the disease.This is the first antiviral Covid-19 pill authorized for ill people to take at home, before they get sick enough to be hospitalized. It\'s authorized for people age 12 and older who weigh at least 88 pounds.Paxlovid combines a new antiviral drug named nirmatrelvir and an older one called ritonavir. Pfizer last week released updated results that showed the treatment cut the risk of hospitalization or death by 89% if given to high-risk adults within a few days of their first symptoms. If given within the first five days of symptoms, the efficacy was similar: 88%.The authorization is an ""enormous step forward"" and ""another way we will be able to live with this disease going forward,"" said Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a former medical adviser in the George W. Bush administration and a professor of medicine and surgery at George Washington University, during a Wednesday appearance on CNN.On the issue of testing, Reiner says the issue is not just being able to order tests, but accessibility. He says Biden\'s announcement of a plan to acquire 500 million tests that Americans can order online is ""great but not enough. Tests need to be available everywhere you look: drug stores, gas stations, banks.""Covid-19 cases in the US are rising: The country averaged more than 148,000 new cases a day over the last week, 23% higher than a week ago and back to levels last seen in mid-September, according to Johns Hopkins University data.The Omicron variant has been identified in every US state, in addition to Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico, according to public statements from hospital systems and state officials in their respective states.More than 69,700 Covid-19 patients were in US hospitals on Wednesday -- a number that\'s been trending up since it dipped to around 45,000 on November 8, according to Health and Human Services Department data.The US averaged 1,324 Covid-19 deaths a day over the last week, 11% higher than a week prior, according to Johns Hopkins.Residents wait in line to receive free Covid-19 at-home test kits on Tuesday in Chelsea, Massachusetts.Hospital beds scarce in some parts of the countryThe surge in cases has also led to a scarcity of hospital beds in pockets of the country. \'An event canceled is better than a life canceled,\' WHO chief warns ahead of holiday seasonIn Delaware, ChristianaCare Hospital is running over 100% capacity, often reaching 110% to 115%, said its president, Sharon Kurfuerst.""There are patients receiving care in hallways because that is the only place we have to put them in the emergency department right now,"" she said. Many people who delayed treatment for nearly two years for non-Covid-19 related health issues currently need medical attention, Kurfuerst added.""That, compounded by the amount of Covid patients that we are seeing today is really straining our health care system and resources,"" she said. In Ohio, six hospitals in the Cleveland area took out a page ad Sunday in the local newspaper, pleading for help.""We need your help,"" the ad read. ""We now have more COVID-19 patients in our hospitals than ever before. And the overwhelming majority are unvaccinated.""NHL to pause season Wednesday and resume after ChristmasGetting vaccinated is the most effective tool to prevent serious illness. As of Tuesday, nearly 62% of the US population had been fully vaccinated, while just over 30% had received a booster shot, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People who have been previously infected with Covid-19 and remain unvaccinated ""should not assume that (they) have protection against Omicron,"" US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said Tuesday. ""That\'s not enough to be able to come to a family gathering and say, \'This is just as good as being vaccinated,\'"" Murthy told CNN\'s Wolf Blitzer. ""So, if you\'re not vaccinated, it is more urgent than ever to get vaccinated. If you are vaccinated, please get boosted."" As US health officials urge vaccination and boosters, Israel is rolling out a fourth vaccine dose for certain people: those ages 60 and over, medical workers and people with suppressed immune systems.In Israel, those eligible for the fourth dose can receive it if at least four months have passed since the third dose, the nation\'s Prime Minister\'s Office said. Almost all vaccinated citizens in that country have received the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine.As to whether the US could move to a fourth dose eventually, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told CNN this: ""Certainly when we see science, we\'ll examine that we will absolutely consider it,"" she said Tuesday on ""AC360."" ""Right now, we\'re working to make sure that our vaccinated people get (a) booster -- we really do want to make sure that people get a boost.""""It is clear that is what (the US is) going to do -- we are just going to take an unnecessarily long time"" to get there. Additionally, and related to a potential fourth booster here in the US, Reiner wants to see not only a sense of urgency, but also ""nimbleness"" on the part of the Biden White House -- with the administration reacting to changing facts on the ground rather than, as Reiner said has happened previously, ""be surprised and then wait.""Now in the US, Covid-19 vaccine boosters mean a third shot for people who initially received two doses of an mRNA vaccine -- those made by Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna -- or a second shot for those who received a single Johnson & Johnson dose. Adults may get boosted with any of the three vaccine brands, regardless of which they received initially; 16- and 17-year-olds are only eligible to receive the Pfizer booster.Local officials impose new rules to combat surgeSome local officials are again imposing new regulations to curb the spread of the virus.In Chicago, customers at most businesses that serve food or drinks must show proof of vaccination beginning January 3, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said. The measure will apply to all customers over age 5 at restaurants, bars, gyms, theaters and other entertainment and sporting venues that serve food and drink.Cleveland area hospitals battling latest Covid-19 surge put ad in local paper that reads: \'Help\'""The unvaccinated are affecting the health, well-being and livelihoods of all the rest of us,"" Lightfoot said. ""To control the spread, we have to limit the risk."" Florida\'s Miami-Dade County is reinstating a mask mandate in county buildings, Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said Wednesday.Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms also moved to reinstate the city\'s indoor mask mandate, while Massachusetts\' public health department is recommending that all residents wear a mask indoors when not in their own homes, regardless of their vaccination status, officials said Tuesday.And in New York, the police department is seeing an increase in the number of officers calling out sick, including fully vaccinated officers, according to numbers shared with CNN by a senior NYPD official.Covid-19 isolation period could be reducedAmid the latest surge, officials are considering shortening the 10-day isolation period for those who test positive, particularly for health care workers, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Tuesday. How long should you isolate if you\'re fully vaccinated but have Covid-19? There is some debate""For example, if you get a health care worker who\'s infected and without any symptoms at all, you don\'t want to keep that person out of work too very long ... particularly if we get a run on hospital beds and the need for health care personnel,"" said Fauci, who is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The isolation period also affects airline staffing, prompting Delta Air Lines officials to ask the CDC to reduce the period to five days as Christmas approaches -- adding that more than 90% of its workforce is vaccinated.Officials are conducting analysis on whether it\'s safe to shorten the isolation period, Murthy said.CNN\'s Melissa Alonso, Amanda Sealy, Jason Hanna, Oren Liebermann, Artemis Moshtaghian, Jennifer Henderson, Pervaiz Shallwani, Mark Morales, Ben Tinker, Gregory Lemos and Naomi Thomas contributed to this report.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN)As President Biden struggles through the roughest patch of his presidency yet -- with his poll numbers in the doldrums and the cornerstone of his Build Back Better legislation in peril -- he can look back at one unalloyed success in his first year. The Senate has confirmed a record number of his nominees to the federal judiciary -- the most of any president at this stage in 40 years -- and at a time when that achievement matters more than ever. In its final days in session for the year, the Senate confirmed 10 district judges, giving Biden a total of 40 confirmations, a tie with Ronald Reagan\'s record. By comparison, the Senate confirmed 18 circuit and district court judges in President Donald Trump\'s first year in office, and 12 in President Barack Obama\'s first year. Biden\'s achievement is especially important at a time when partisanship in the judiciary is nearly as pervasive as it is in the political branches.Republicans learned this lesson before Democrats did. When Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican, was Senate majority leader during the Trump years, he put judicial confirmations at the top of his agenda. Thanks to McConnell, the Senate confirmed 54 appellate judges during Trump\'s one term, just one fewer than Obama appointed in his two terms. McConnell\'s Supreme CourtIn overall numbers, according to Pew Research Center, Trump\'s total of 226 in his single term is below the totals of recent two-term presidents, including Obama (320), George W. Bush (322) and Bill Clinton (367). But according to a Washington Post analysis, Trump appointed the youngest group of judges since at least the start of the 20th century. The average age of his appellate court judges was 47, about five years younger than Obama\'s appellate judges. Since all federal judges enjoy life tenure, Trump created a legacy that would be difficult to reverse.But Biden -- with the crucial assistance of Chuck Schumer, the current Senate majority leader, and Richard Durbin, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee -- has fought back. While the Senate has struggled to move much of Biden\'s legislative agenda, Schumer has filled the time with confirmations, and his fellow Democrats (including the otherwise resistant Joe Manchin and Krysten Sinema) have confirmed every one. Biden\'s judges so far are generally younger and more diverse than even Obama\'s were. For example, according to figures compiled by the American Constitution Society, about 80 percent of Biden\'s judicial nominees have been women, compared to 42 percent for Obama and 24 percent for Trump. About 36 percent of Obama\'s nominees were members of minority groups, compared to about 67 percent for Biden, and 16 percent for Trump. And Biden has drawn from a broader pool of lawyers, too. Obama chose a great many former prosecutors for the bench, Biden has looked to defense lawyers as well. Halfway into his first year, Biden\'s legacy in this regard is formidable already.Read MoreOpinion: Clarence Thomas Is the new Chief Justice Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. has famously asserted that our nation\'s judges are independent of politics and ""dedicated"" to nonpartisanship. ""We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges,"" he said. But in recent years the difference between Democratic and Republican judicial appointees has been vast and growing. This is not because the judges are unethical or partisan hacks (at least most of them), but rather because judicial philosophy and political orientation have rarely been as closely aligned as they are today. Democrats and Republicans simply have different and profound disagreements about what the Constitution means.Consider several recent legal controversies. In October, Robert Pitman, an Obama appointee to the federal district court in Texas, ruled that the state\'s draconian anti-abortion rights law known as SB 8 was unconstitutional. Republican-appointed judges overturned him. Similarly, four Democratic appointees have ruled against Trump\'s effort to prevent Congress from gaining access to executive branch records in the investigation of the January 6 riot at the Capitol: The district court ruling was by an Obama appointee, and it was affirmed by a DC Circuit panel of two Obama judges and one Biden judge. Republican-appointed judges have, in turn, stymied Democratic priorities, as when a three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit rejected the Biden administration\'s vaccine mandate for large employers. The judges were one Reagan and two Trump appointees. Attorney General Merrick Garland, don\'t prosecute Donald Trump Of course, one Trump record that Biden cannot hope to equal involves the most important federal court of all. McConnell\'s most consequential acts as majority leader allowed Trump to fill three seats on the Supreme Court. McConnell forbade consideration of Merrick Garland as a replacement for Antonin Scalia during the last year of Obama\'s presidency, paving the way for Trump to nominate Neil Gorsuch in his inaugural year. He then steered Brett Kavanaugh through a tumultuous confirmation and then jammed through the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett in the waning days of Trump\'s presidency. The Supreme Court is now the most partisan of federal courts, one with a clear conservative majority on such issues as abortion, affirmative action, gun safety and many others. Even if Stephen Breyer, the 83-year-old liberal, retires in the next year and Biden replaces him, the current President cannot reasonably hope to change that lineup in the near future.Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion\'s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookAnd Biden\'s first-term record of judicial accomplishment stands on a fragile base as well. If the Democrats lose even a single Senate seat in the 2022 midterms (as historical trends suggest they will), McConnell will again be majority leader and in a position to bring judicial confirmations to a halt. Certainly, McConnell will not allow Biden to fill a seat on the Supreme Court. That means Biden, along with Schumer and Durbin, will have to keep up the same pace of appointing and confirming judges in the next year if they want a legacy that even Mitch McConnell can\'t undo.', ""Commander is the Biden family's new German shepherd.@POTUS/TwitterIn pictures: Presidential pets through historyUpdated 12:17 PM ET, Tue December 21, 2021Commander is the Biden family's new German shepherd.@POTUS/TwitterA new puppy is in the White House.Commander, a German shepherd, arrived on Monday, December 20.

(CNN)President Joe Biden is struggling in the minds of the American public. While his approval rating is down on a slew of issues, his difficulties are perhaps most noticeable on the economy. Biden now sports the lowest net economic rating of any president at this point through their first term since at least Jimmy Carter in 1977. In the latest CNN/SSRS poll, Biden comes in with a 44% approval rating to 55% disapproval rating among registered voters on his economic performance. This makes for a -9 point net approval rating. The average of all polls taken in December is quite similar with Biden at -13 points on the economy. To put that in perspective, the average president at this point in the last 44 years (since we have been polling on the topic) had a net economic approval rating of +5 points. That means Biden\'s is 18 points worse than the average. Who\'s to blame for inflation? It\'s complicatedThe best rating, perhaps unsurprisingly, belonged to George W. Bush following the September 11 attacks. He was at +37 points at a time when his approval ratings on all issues were high thanks to the ""rally around the flag"" effect. Read MoreNotably, Biden\'s net rating is worse than his two immediate predecessors, Barack Obama in December 2009 and Donald Trump in December 2017. Both Obama and Trump had net approval ratings on the economy of -4 points. The economy was, by a lot of measures, in deep trouble in December 2009. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index was well below average at 72.5. Today, it\'s at a similar 70.4. Yet, Biden\'s ratings on the economy are considerably worse. Trump was a different story. Consumer sentiment was at 95.9 in December 2017, but Trump\'s overall net approval ratings (-20 points) were so bad that they were dragging down his popularity on a host of issues. Interestingly, Trump\'s problem then is the opposite of Biden\'s now. Back in late 2017, most voters were not concentrated on the economy. It was not the nation\'s top problem. Ergo, what Americans saw as a relatively stronger economy wasn\'t translating into helping Trump. Today, the economy is viewed as the top problem for both the nation and for people\'s families, so the low consumer sentiment is dragging Biden down. A Monmouth University poll released earlier this month found that 41% listed economic concerns (either everyday bills and groceries; inflation; job security and employment; or the economy overall) as the top issue for their family. That\'s far more than for any other issue. Inflation, in particular, seems to be a big issue for Biden. Just 28% of Americans approved of the job he is doing to handle inflation in a recent ABC News/Ipsos poll. This comes as more voters said they were concerned about inflation than any other issue in a December Fox News poll, and only 22% said the Biden\'s administration efforts to get inflation and rising prices under control were helping. The plurality (47%) said they were hurting. Indeed, the issue of inflation hurting a president helps to put Biden\'s bad position in perspective. The public reaction now looks at least somewhat similar to how the public was reacting to another president under whom inflation was an issue: Carter. A lot of Republicans like to draw parallels between Carter (who was a one-term president) and Biden. And at least early on, when it comes to public perceptions of the economy and inflation, there are some similarities between them. Carter\'s economic net approval rating of -8 points in an early January 1978 CBS News/New York Times poll was the lowest around this point in a presidency before Biden\'s -13 points. The economy, and particularly inflation, was listed as the nation\'s top problem in a late October 1977 Gallup poll. Importantly, far more Americans (52%) in a November 1977 Time Magazine poll thought that Carter was not making a good start to fighting inflation than thought he was (21%). In other words, Americans felt his efforts were not enough to control inflation. The good news for Biden is that it\'s far from clear what the economy and inflation will look like in the future. Carter ended up losing in 1980, in part, because voters felt he didn\'t solve the economic crisis. Biden, on the other hand, still has nearly three years until the 2024 election, although his party may still suffer in the midterms because of fears voters have about the economy.', 'The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022By Simone Pathe, CNNUpdated 8:28 PM ET, Sun December 19, 2021 JUST WATCHED\'Democrats are in a lot of trouble\': Harry Enten on 2022 midtermsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH (17 Videos)\'Democrats are in a lot of trouble\': Harry Enten on 2022 midtermsEx-Ted Cruz aide: Media focusing on wrong part of Fox interviewPolitico apologizes for their story about this photoThis governor tells businesses in his state not to comply with the vaccine mandateTapper presses NYC mayor on appointing his brother as NYPD officialReporter explains why McConnell isn\'t talking about TrumpFormer aide on whether Pence will speak to Jan. 6 committeeBiden tears into Trump during January 6th speechEx-Trump aide describes the worry with Trump\'s \'fragile ego\'See Jake Tapper\'s plea to RepublicansLawmaker shares a \'defining memory\' from the January 6th insurrectionHonig: This shows NY AG is broadening her Trump investigationPediatrician to FL governor: \'Listen to science\' now more than everCNN commentator calls out AOC\'s \'creepy weirdos\' tweetWhat to expect on the first anniversary of the January 6th Capitol riotTwitter suspends Marjorie Taylor Greene account over Covid-19 misinformationCheney: Trump sat in White House watching Capitol attack on TV (CNN)As the calendar turns to 2022, Senate races are about to kick into much higher gear, with ad spending increasing ahead of the first primaries in May and just a few more fundraising quarters for candidates to prove they\'re serious \'A 50-50 Senate sucks\': Dejected Democrats fret over agenda failure amid grim 2022 outlook The biggest storyline to watch heading into 2022 is the resolution of contested GOP primaries. In at least six of the 10 states on this list, Republicans are facing unsettled fields -- some more problematic for the party than others -- that may go a long way toward shaping their ability to harness a favorable political environment. Developments in these states over the past month have been mixed for the GOP. Some Republicans feel like they dodged a bullet in Pennsylvania, where the candidate backed by former President Donald Trump dropped out. But in New Hampshire, they\'re disappointed the governor isn\'t running for Senate. The power of the ex-President\'s endorsement is still an open question in some places, but as Republicans across the country scramble for his blessing, primaries look very much like the Trump loyalty contests of 2018 and 2020 -- except with the added (and increasingly dangerous) litmus test of election denialism. Candidates are repeating various versions of Trump\'s lies about fraud in the 2020 election to curry favor with the former commander in chief. \nBut as elections in Virginia and New Jersey last month showed, the national environment is significantly worse for Democrats than it was just months after President Joe Biden\'s victory and after Democrats flipped two Georgia Senate seats. Rising inflation and a pandemic that is once again raising questions about Americans\' ability to gather this holiday season are contributing to a gloomy mood that\'s overshadowed any enthusiasm about Washington having passed a bipartisan infrastructure deal. Three-quarters of Americans say they are worried about the state of the economy in their own community, according to a new CNN poll released Wednesday. More than half disapprove of the way Biden is handling the economy. Read MoreThe party in the White House typically suffers losses in the first midterm of a new president\'s term. Next year isn\'t looking any different, with longtime House Democrats already heading for the exit -- a tell-tale sign of veteran lawmakers who aren\'t eager to be in the minority. But at the close of the so-called off-year, the Senate map doesn\'t look all that different from this spring, when CNN first ranked the seats most likely to flip. The top three seats, for example, remain the same: Pennsylvania, Georgia and Wisconsin. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip are based on CNN\'s reporting and fundraising data, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed. As the cycle heats up, more polling and advertising spending data will become factors.Here are the seats most likely to flip next fall:  1. PennsylvaniaIncumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring)The biggest shakeup over the last month was the departure of Army veteran Sean Parnell -- a relief for Republicans who had begun to worry that the headlines from the Trump-backed candidate\'s custody battle could seriously hurt his ability to win a general election. (Parnell suspended his campaign after a judge awarded his estranged wife primary physical custody and sole legal custody of the couple\'s three children.) His exodus has made room for ambitious Republicans who smell an opportunity, like Dr. Mehmet Oz, a cardiothoracic surgeon and television personality. The Ohio native, who attended medical school in the state, has talked up the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a way to treat the coronavirus — despite the lack of firm scientific evidence that it is an effective treatment. ""Washington got Covid wrong,"" he says in a TV ad, vowing to ""put America first."" A longtime New Jersey resident, Oz is not the only candidate or potential candidate who\'s lived elsewhere, although it remains to be seen whether voters really care about that in such a nationalized political environment. David McCormick, a former official in the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush, may soon enter the race, joining businessman Jeff Bartos, who helped publicize Parnell\'s personal life issues after Trump passed him over for the endorsement, and Carla Sands, Trump\'s ambassador to Denmark. With GOP Sen. Pat Toomey retiring, Democrats have long seen the Keystone State, which voted for Biden, as one of their top pickup opportunities. Democrats have a crowded primary of their own -- and the GOP is excited about the prospect of facing top fundraiser Lt. Gov. John Fetterman -- but the fundamentals of the state make this one harder for Republicans to hold than some others.2. GeorgiaIncumbent: Democrat Raphael WarnockThe intrigue in Georgia has shifted from the Senate race -- where Republican Herschel Walker seems to have married the interests of Trump and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell -- to the gubernatorial race, with former Sen. David Perdue announcing a Trump-backed primary challenge to GOP Gov. Brian Kemp earlier this month. McConnell had once sought Perdue or former Sen. Kelly Loeffler, both of whom lost January runoffs, to challenge Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who\'s now running for a full six-year term. But Perdue\'s gubernatorial candidacy underscores just how much the GOP Senate landscape here has changed (although Walker still faces a primary against Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black and former Trump national security official Latham Saddler among others.) Some Republicans who had once balked at Walker running in the Peach State now seem impressed by his team and argue that his openness about his mental health struggles could be a positive attribute on the campaign trail. And the fact that Walker wouldn\'t wade into the gubernatorial primary was seen as a sign he\'s taking his race seriously rather than just bowing to the political whims of Trump, who has called Perdue and Walker an ""unstoppable team."" On the Democratic side, news that 2018 nominee Stacey Abrams is running for governor again is exciting Democrats, who hope she\'ll help drive minority turnout in a non-presidential year. High-profile names in the governor\'s race ensure that Georgia will once again be the epicenter of the political universe in 2022.  3. WisconsinIncumbent: Republican Ron JohnsonGOP Sen. Ron Johnson has plenty to say about Covid-19 these days -- much of it misleading or offensive -- but less about whether he\'s running for a third term. As of now, he would be the only Republican senator running for reelection in a state Biden carried in 2020. While he keeps Republicans guessing, Democrats have assembled a crowded field that\'s just as eager to take on the incumbent as run for an open seat. Biden only won this state by about half a point last year, however, after Trump won it by a similarly narrow margin in 2016. That makes it competitive terrain that may not be so favorable to Democrats if the national environment is against them. But whether he runs or not, Johnson, who\'s already been endorsed by Trump, isn\'t doing himself -- or his party -- any favors. His penchant for saying controversial things, while it may be resonating with GOP base voters, is giving Democrats a rich target as they try to peel off independents. And should he decide not to run for reelection, his prolonged indecision isn\'t giving potential GOP successors the opportunity to start introducing themselves around the state. 4. ArizonaIncumbent: Democrat Mark KellyDemocratic Sen. Mark Kelly is running for a full six-year term after winning a special election last year. An astronaut and the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, he has a compelling personal story and is an impressive fundraiser. The biggest advantage he may have right now, however, is a Republican field in disarray without an obvious candidate that can cut through the noise. Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who holds the most prominent statewide elected office of the bunch, doesn\'t seem to be putting together the resources needed for a top-tier campaign. Trump hasn\'t endorsed here, so the candidates will continue to snipe about who\'s most loyal to him and his ideas about election fraud. But the primary isn\'t until August, so whoever emerges as the nominee will need to quickly pivot to general election mode. Still, Biden became the first Democrat to carry the state since 1996 -- and by less than half a point -- so this state will likely be competitive regardless of the matchup. 5. NevadaIncumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez MastoThis is one GOP primary that\'s relatively settled, with former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt already having the backing of both McConnell and Trump. The grandson of the former governor and senator with the same last name, Laxalt is trying to unseat first-term Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, the country\'s first Latina senator. ""Nevada is a purple state, and it\'s always competitive,"" she told CNN in a recent interview. Indeed, she only won by about 2 points in 2016, as did Hillary Clinton -- a margin Biden replicated four years later. GOP inroads with Hispanic voters could make this seat more competitive -- especially if Republicans are already focused on the general election campaign and not wasting all their time and money in as messy a primary as they are in other states -- while the state Democratic Party is the one struggling with internal divisions. Democrats are trying to paint Laxalt, the former Trump campaign co-chair for the state, as out of touch with Nevadans. He\'s questioned Biden\'s victory in the state and opposes abortion. (Nevada has a history of Republicans backing abortion rights in former Gov. Brian Sandoval, who declined to endorse Laxalt when he unsuccessfully ran to succeed him.) And with major abortion rights cases before the Supreme Court, the issue could make it into more campaign ads than usual in 2022. But Republicans point to voters\' economic concerns, arguing that playing up abortion (the way Democrats infamously did in a 2014 Colorado Senate race) could backfire. Cortez Masto, however, has also been talking up her support for the bipartisan infrastructure law as a contrast between her and Laxalt. 6. North CarolinaIncumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring)North Carolina\'s primaries had been among the earliest in the nation, but candidates now have a few extra weeks to make their case to voters, with the state Supreme Court delaying the nominating contests from March to May because of redistricting legal challenges. The Republican field is still reckoning with Trump\'s early endorsement of Rep. Ted Budd, as the political arm of the conservative Club for Growth spends big to promote him as the former President\'s chosen candidate. As CNN has reported, Trump enlisted Rep. Madison Cawthorn to try to convince former Rep. Mark Walker to run for the House instead since Budd allies think they\'d have a stronger shot in a one-on-one race against former Gov. Pat McCrory, who occupies a more establishment Republican lane. Walker and his wife, seated in front of a Christmas tree and stockings, said in a video message released earlier this week that they\'d be reviewing his options over the holidays. ""On paper, it makes more sense for us to reengage in the US House and continue this fight,"" Walker said, noting there was a ""narrow path"" to Senate victory. While Republicans continue to attack each other here, the Democratic field has essentially sorted itself, positioning Cheri Beasley -- the first Black woman to serve as chief justice of the state Supreme Court -- as the likely nominee. Former state Sen. Erica Smith switched to a House race last month, and state Sen. Jeff Jackson dropped out Thursday, arguing that Democrats need to be united to have a chance of flipping this seat.  7. New HampshireIncumbent: Democrat Maggie HassanChristmas came early for first-term Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan last month when the Republicans who could have given her the closest race passed. Gov. Chris Sununu announced he\'d run for reelection, which was quickly followed by former Sen. Kelly Ayotte taking herself out of contention. Ret. Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, who raised just five figures in the third quarter, isn\'t likely to have the GOP field to himself much longer. There\'s no shortage of Republican names swirling around -- with announcements likely coming in the new year -- but that\'s also what worries some Republicans: if there\'s no field-clearing name like Sununu, candidates could be duking it out until the September primary. Republicans have always felt that Hassan was vulnerable, with or without Sununu, and although the Granite State has trended blue in recent federal elections, they\'re optimistic a favorable national environment will put this one in play for them. Still, without a well-defined GOP opponent ready to take on Hassan, this race remains in the bottom half of the seats most likely to flip. 8. Florida Incumbent: Republican Marco RubioGOP Sen. Marco Rubio is running for a third term with the backing of Trump and is likely to face Democratic Rep. Val Demings. It\'s an uphill climb for Democrats in a state that\'s trended red in recent years, but Demings\' profile as the former Orlando police chief and her impressive fundraising are likely to keep Democrats at least competitive. She outraised Rubio by about $2.5 million in the third quarter, although he ended with more cash on hand. Whether she\'s able to sustain that momentum (and whether it translates to on-the-ground support) will be key questions heading into the new year. 9. OhioIncumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring)This is another race where the retirement of a GOP veteran has given way to a messy primary. There\'s a wide field of wannabe GOP successors to Sen. Rob Portman, except few of them want to actually replicate his tenure in Congress, where he was one of the lead negotiators of the bipartisan infrastructure law. Most are more interested in earning the endorsement of Trump (who trashed the infrastructure deal) and are attacking each other over their loyalty to the ex-President. Trump hasn\'t picked a favorite here yet but has indicated he will eventually. Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, meanwhile, has been coalescing support to win his primary. Regardless of who emerges from the Republican primary, however, Ryan is in for a tough general election in an increasingly red state. 10. MissouriIncumbent: Republican Roy Blunt (retiring)Trump has also suggested he\'ll be endorsing in Missouri\'s Senate race, where GOP Sen. Roy Blunt is retiring. The biggest concern has been that he\'d pick disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens, who resigned from office following a probe into allegations of sexual and campaign misconduct. Trump was noncommittal in an interview with Hugh Hewitt earlier this month, who implored him not to endorse the former governor. ""Well, that\'s an interesting opinion, that\'s true. He\'s right now leading by quite a bit,"" Trump said. ""I know, but he will lose the seat. We will lose the seat,"" Hewitt said. ""I understand that. Okay, some people feel that,"" Trump responded. Kimberly Guilfoyle, a top official on Trump\'s 2020 campaign and the girlfriend of Trump\'s son, is the national chair of Greitens\' campaign. GOP Rep. Billy Long met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago last month, so he could be another potential endorsee. But the field keeps growing, with state Senate President Dave Schatz announcing his campaign last month. The fear is that an increasingly splintered field will only mean more votes for Greitens, who could jeopardize what should be a safe Republican seat much the same way Todd Akin did in 2012.', '', 'The economic catastrophe that wasn\'t: How Washington found a way to quietly raise the debt ceiling By Phil Mattingly, CNNUpdated 8:00 AM ET, Sun December 19, 2021 JUST WATCHEDThis former senator has an idea for how to fix the SenateReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThis former senator has an idea for how to fix the Senate 13:19 (CNN)Even as the partisan battle lines for the next epic political clash were being drawn, President Joe Biden had no desire to engage.  ""Nope,"" Biden said matter-of-factly in August when asked by a reporter if he was concerned about the potential for a US default on its debt. ""They\'re not going to let us default."" The comments, which bordered on a casual dismissal, came as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was rallying Republicans behind the idea that Democrats would have to approve any debt ceiling increase themselves. Washington, once again, was barreling toward a self-imposed crisis that would rattle markets, threaten the US credit rating and, as has been the case for the better part of a decade, create yet another reason for Americans to question the government\'s ability to handle the most basic of tasks. In the moment, Biden\'s brush-off appeared to be a misunderstanding of the dynamics that threatened to overtake Capitol Hill. Read MoreInstead, what it was -- according to interviews with multiple people involved in the events that would take place over the next four months -- was an early window into a strategy that would ultimately play a role in what became a crisis-free resolution that transpired with oddly little fanfare. ""It\'s giving the system enough space to breathe so that we don\'t create unnecessary political or partisan anxiety,"" Steve Ricchetti, one of Biden\'s closest advisers and point people on Capitol Hill, said in an interview when asked to describe the White House posture. There are no shortage of major issues Biden and his team are grappling with as they prepare to enter his second year in office. The pandemic is entering a winter surge, and the economic dislocations that have come along with it continue to rattle an economy that by many metrics is otherwise in the midst of a robust recovery. Biden\'s cornerstone domestic legislative priority will be punted into next year amid continued disagreements with Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the key Democratic holdout, and critical presidential priorities ranging from voting rights to gun restrictions have no clear path forward due to Senate Republican opposition. Yet on the issues of basic governance -- the baseline requirements of any federal government that have been the center of so many crises in the last decade -- Biden and leaders on Capitol Hill have managed to methodically handle them with limited theatrics. ""Maybe it\'s a low bar,"" a Democratic senator told CNN with a chuckle. ""But it\'s one we haven\'t really cleared without drama in a long time."" A Senate agreement The pathway out of a looming debt ceiling crisis didn\'t hatch at the White House. It was, by all accounts, an agreement driven by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and McConnell, two leaders who have had a complex and frosty relationship defined more by Senate floor speech attack lines than substantive closed-door meetings. It\'s what made McConnell\'s mid-November request to meet with Schumer something that raised eyebrows in Schumer\'s office and at the White House. McConnell had for months made clear that any debt ceiling increase would need to fall on the backs of Senate Democrats. He\'d even laid out the mechanism for the majority to accomplish that desire -- an onerous budgetary procedure that would allow an increase through a simple majority vote. But Schumer had set his party\'s path -- raising the debt ceiling through budget reconciliation was, in his view, a dicey nonstarter and he had no intention of blinking.  Senate Democrats repeatedly rebuffed McConnell\'s push, objections that grew louder, more entrenched, and perhaps most importantly, even more unified after the Kentucky Republican backed off his demand to clear the way for a short-term increase in October. There was furor over the idea of turning what had become a bipartisan necessity in the last decade -- one Democrats helped former President Donald Trump address three times -- into something required only of the majority. There was anger that the minority, no matter how slim, was attempting to dictate the change in process.  Yet even as McConnell made clear directly to Biden that Republicans wouldn\'t help with another debt ceiling increase -- first in a scathing letter, then in a phone call with the President described by one person as matter-of-fact and devoid of fireworks -- the political dynamics had started to shift. Democrats were struggling to find the path forward on Biden\'s cornerstone domestic legislation, the Build Back Better Act. The party\'s poll numbers -- and the President\'s -- had taken a hit in the process, thanks to a persistent pandemic and rising prices driven by supply constraints. McConnell had always been clear that default wasn\'t a hot stove he had any intention of touching. Now the idea of risking that, in a way that would thrust Republicans into the middle of a partisan battle that could end in catastrophe, carried zero appeal. ""They\'re lighting themselves on fire,"" one Republican official said of the view of Democratic poll numbers. ""There\'s zero reason for us to jump in the flames with them right before a midterm year, right?"" McConnell, throughout the year, had also keenly observed the pressure on Democratic Sens. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Manchin to ditch the filibuster. Both had rejected growing Democratic desire to go down that path, but both were clear the debt ceiling wasn\'t something that should be a political pawn. McConnell decided to broach a pathway toward a debt ceiling increase with Schumer. Ramping up the pressureBiden administration officials, throughout the fall, deployed the tried-and-true levers of the last decade to ramp up pressure on Republicans. There were the strategically timed letters and phone calls from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen laying out the urgency and shrinking timeline to default. There were letters and calls from business and banking groups warning of dire economic consequences. There was even a letter from bipartisan former Defense secretaries that, in a late addition, included the signature of rock-ribbed conservative Dick Cheney, who led the Pentagon under President George H.W. Bush and went on to serve as President George W. Bush\'s vice president. Yet, even as they made clear there was no daylight between Schumer and Biden, Biden\'s top deputies took pains not to elevate the issue in public comments. Schumer and White House chief of staff Ron Klain were in regular contact, ""sometimes multiple times a day,"" one official noted, and Klain regularly backed Schumer\'s position inside the West Wing, even when some of Biden\'s economic officials raised concerns about pushing things too close to the brink, people familiar with the matter said. But White House officials were also careful not to close any potential off-ramps should they come to the forefront. Throughout, the open lines of communication with McConnell\'s office were maintained. It\'s, in part, a necessity -- in a 50-50 Senate, the minority leader\'s office is a critical player in the basic functioning of the chamber. But it was also a reflection of the relationship Biden has sought to maintain with McConnell. White House officials are candid about the reality that one of their cornerstone legislative achievements of their first year, the $1.2 trillion infrastructure law, wouldn\'t have been possible had McConnell moved to short-circuit the effort. While he wasn\'t a lead negotiator and kept his own cards close to the vest, McConnell was quietly involved as a group of Senate Democrats and Republicans mapped out the deal with their White House counterparts.  Biden made a point of thanking McConnell in his televised remarks at the signing ceremony for the bill, even though the senator wasn\'t among the hundreds in attendance.Two veteran legislators who were critical deal makers in past fiscal battles when Biden served as vice president, they don\'t view each other as old friends and don\'t engage in regular calls to check in or compare notes on family and friends, people familiar with their relationship say. They do, however, share an understanding that if they\'re talking, it\'s likely because there is an area or problem of mutual interest and -- without much pretense, hyperbole or fanfare -- they need to find a pathway toward a solution.  The two would speak more than once as the debt ceiling resolution came to fruition. Democrats get togetherAfter McConnell broached the meeting with Schumer, the New York Democrat picked up on the desire to address the debt ceiling on the annual defense authorization bill that was set to move through both chambers. Schumer wanted to let Speaker Nancy Pelosi know of the potential breakthrough in advance of his meeting with McConnell but couldn\'t reach her by phone. He then realized both were heading to the same climate change news conference outside the House side of the Capitol. Schumer sprinted over to reach the California Democrat before the event started and asked her to stay close by after she was done speaking. The two walked to Schumer\'s car and got inside, and the New Yorker walked through what was on the table. The next day, McConnell came to Schumer\'s office to go through the potential details. After the Thanksgiving holiday, Schumer and McConnell met again for 30 minutes just off the Senate floor to finalize the agreement. Schumer called Pelosi and Klain to read them in on the agreement to include a fast-track provision to allow for a simple majority vote on the debt limit on the defense bill. House Republicans, who Pelosi would need to pass the defense authorization bill, rejected the idea, leading McConnell and Schumer to package the fast-track measure with two must-pass provisions. Throughout the process, White House officials made clear that Biden would be behind any agreement, even though there were questions as to whether McConnell could secure the 10 Republicans needed to clear the fast-track bill. They had good reason -- several McConnell allies in the conference had panned the idea to reporters before he had read them in on the details. But within 18 hours, after McConnell privately walked through his rationale -- and made clear Democrats alone would be responsible for not only voting to raise the debt ceiling, but also attaching a $2.5 trillion number to the increase -- 14 Senate Republicans would end up joining all 50 Democrats to advance the fast track measure.""It was pretty remarkable to watch him turn that around,"" said one administration official, who -- despite being wary of coming across as complimentary of McConnell -- willingly acknowledged the Kentuckian\'s ability to get the votes in line. Democrats would pass the debt ceiling increase on a party-line vote five days later. McConnell made a point of noting that only Democrats technically voted for the increase. Schumer pointed out that Democrats didn\'t use the reconciliation process -- and a bipartisan agreement set up the ultimate resolution. There was, in short, something in the final agreement for everyone.  ""Responsible governing has won on this exceedingly important issue,"" Schumer said. ""The American people can breathe easy, and rest assured there will not be a default.""In the span of two weeks, Congress had placed the pin back in the default grenade until after the midterm elections and funded the government with minimal drama. The annual defense authorization bill also moved through. ""These folks have found ways to work together and see their way through what have been historically, over the last 15 or 20 years, sometimes thorny or extraordinarily disruptive and painful issues,"" Ricchetti, who serves as a counselor to the President, said of McConnell, Schumer, Pelosi and Biden. \'Just do the work\'As lawmakers prepared to depart for the Christmas holiday last week, Schumer and McConnell were once again on the floor laying down attack lines. McConnell ramped up his all-out war against Biden\'s $1.75 trillion economic and climate package, saying at one point that the best Christmas gift for Americans ""would be putting this bad bill on ice.""Schumer, who was managing intra-party divides on the Build Back Better proposal and voting rights efforts, trained his fire on Republicans, who -- in his words -- ""will not join us to defend democracy.""Biden was grappling with an ominous winter Covid surge as Manchin continued to throw a wrench into the President\'s efforts to secure one more major legislative win for the year. Shortly before noon on Thursday, with no fanfare or signing ceremony, the White House sent out a news release announcing Biden had signed the debt ceiling increase. There would be no default.""Not a lot of drama. Not a lot of hyperventilation,"" Ricchetti said. ""Just do the work.""', 'The current Supreme Court\'s partisan moment rivals Bush v.

Individual justices themselves say it. The court\'s message to the country in recent months has smacked of politics. Most conspicuously, the justices have repeatedly rejected requests to prevent a Texas abortion law that outright conflicts with women\'s constitutional rights under the 1973 Roe v. Wade. The remade conservative majority also appears ready to strike down New York gun control regulations and require state aid for religious schools in Maine. This moment has been building for years, as the politicized confirmation process delivered justices with firmer ideologies and agendas. But the court\'s right turn has been startlingly accelerated by the abortion-rights controversy. What makes this juncture so fraught is the politicized circumstances, the threat to precedent and the warnings from justices themselves. What John Roberts\' role in Texas\' abortion case could signal for the future of RoeFormer President Donald Trump vowed to appoint justices who would oppose abortion rights and overturn Roe v. Wade, and all three of his appointees appear to be working toward that goal with speed. Read MoreMore than anything in recent years, the justices\' actions in abortion cases from Texas and Mississippi have belied Chief Justice John Roberts\' adage of 2018, in retort to Trump himself: ""We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges."" While the Texas dispute has suspended abortion rights in that state, a pending Mississippi case would have nationwide ramifications. During oral arguments on December 1, a majority appeared ready to overturn the half-century old Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal nationwide. The justices in 1973 said the 14th Amendment\'s guarantee of privacy covers a woman\'s right to terminate a pregnancy in the early stages. The current situation recalls, and perhaps rivals, the Bush v. Gore controversy of 2000, when dissenting senior Justice John Paul Stevens lamented the loss of ""the Nation\'s confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law."" Last week in the Texas abortion case, dissenting Chief Justice Roberts warned, ""it is the role of the Supreme Court in our constitutional system that is at stake."" The 2000 case resolving the disputed Florida presidential election results and ensuring then-Texas Governor George W. Bush won the White House over then-Vice President Al Gore shook the country. The legal issues were largely contained, despite the obvious national implications. The case was decided 5-4 along ideological, if not political, lines.Today\'s disregard for precedent and the potential domino effect in other cases suggests a whole new era at America\'s high court. Justice Sonia Sotomayor regularly warns the country about the court\'s direction. ""This choice to shrink from Texas\' challenge to federal supremacy will have far-reaching repercussions,"" she wrote last Friday. ""I doubt the Court, let alone the country, is prepared to them."" Roberts as naysayer, however, is new. ""The clear purpose and actual effect of S.B. 8 has been to nullify this Court\'s rulings,"" he said of the Texas abortion ban, adding, with language from an 1809 precedent, that if other states ""annul the judgments of the courts of the United States, and destroy the rights acquired under those judgments, the constitution itself becomes a solemn mockery."" Sign of the times  It is a sign of this court\'s rightward march that Roberts, a conservative Republican appointee, agonizes over the turn of events. President Joe Biden\'s bipartisan commission on Supreme Court reform, which issued a cautious, measured report last week without concrete recommendations, highlighted the politics of the moment and questions of court legitimacy.  It emphasized how much power individual justices now hold (serving for an average of 26 years, up from an average 15 years in the 1960s) and the investment of the dueling political parties in who is appointed. Biden Supreme Court commission\'s draft report details \'profound\' disagreement over adding seats to bench""The highly polarized politics of the current era threaten to transform this already high-stakes process into one that is badly broken,"" the commission wrote, saying that the current calls to expand the size of the court trace to 2016 when Senate Republicans refused to act on President Barack Obama\'s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland. After the GOP-controlled Senate shut out Garland, it sped through Trump\'s choices of Neil Gorsuch in 2017, Brett Kavanaugh in 2018 and Amy Coney Barrett in 2020. Those three new justices, augmenting a prior right-wing tilt, have altered public expectations for both sides of such culture war issues as abortion, guns and religion. During the Mississippi arguments earlier this month, Kavanaugh diminished the value of precedent and, shunning the right enshrined in 1973, imagined a Constitution that would be, in his words, ""neutral ... neither pro-choice nor pro-life."" His words clashed with his 2018 Senate testimony, when he professed respect for Roe and related cases.In a separate, contentious area of the law, the conservative majority has increasingly allowed mixing of church and state. In recent oral arguments, it appeared ready to strike down a Maine education program that provides vouchers for public and private schools, but not those with a sectarian religious curriculum. Liberal Justice Elena Kagan stressed the distinct nature of the program serving students in isolated areas and raised the risk of a sweeping decision directing taxpayer money to religious schools that exclude non-Christians and LGBTQ students: ""These schools are overtly discriminatory. They\'re proudly discriminatory. Other people won\'t understand why in the world their taxpayer dollars are going to discriminatory schools."" Unlike with the new abortion-rights controversy, the shift toward conservative religious interests has been developing for years. And the pattern on church-state dilemmas is not without caveat, as seen this week when the justices brushed away religious objections to New York\'s vaccine mandate. Supreme Court ruling on Texas law was the result of decades of pressure from anti-abortion groups to shape the courtSiding with doctors and nurses who protested that the mandate lacked any religious exemptions, Gorsuch wrote in dissent: ""We should know the costs that come when this Court stands silent as majorities invade the constitutional rights of the unpopular and unorthodox.""The shift on abortion rights has prompted the greatest internal recriminations and public outcry. It became evident on September 1 when the court by a 5-4 vote let Texas go forward with a law that prohibits abortion after the detection of a fetal heartbeat, at roughly six weeks. State lawmakers have tried to shield themselves from federal lawsuit by turning over enforcement of the law to private citizens. That tactic outraged Roberts and the three liberals who dissented in September and also from last week\'s decision that largely disadvantaged the abortion clinics seeking to prevent the law from being used against them. Gorsuch and fellow conservatives in the majority expressed scant concern for Texas insulating itself from legal responsibility, and, alternatively, found the clinics\' position troubling, as they seek to block the ban that could lead to devastating liability. ""Troubling,"" Gorsuch wrote, ""the petitioners have not offered any meaningful limiting principles for their theory."" California governor says he will use legal tactics of Texas abortion ban to implement gun controlUnder S.B. 8, any person can bring a case against a physician or anyone who assists a woman in obtaining an abortion after six weeks; it allows a minimum of $10,000 in damages for successful suits. The Gorsuch bloc permitted lawsuits against one group of state officers, certain licensing officials, but kept S.B. 8 in place. Roberts said the law had already chilled the provision of abortions in Texas, denying women rights that the court had previously upheld. The separate case from Mississippi involves a ban on abortion after 15 weeks. While less restrictive than the Texas statute, it blatantly conflicts with the court\'s abortion-rights decisions prohibiting states from interfering with a woman\'s choice to end a pregnancy before a fetus reaches viability, that is, can live outside the womb, at about 23 weeks. Roe v. Wade set the fetal-viability cutoff, and it was reaffirmed in the 1992 decision known as Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The majority then, five justices who happened to be Republican appointees, took account of all the political pressure on them to reverse precedent. As they declined, they emphasized the importance of stability in the law. The 1992 adherence to Roe, Kagan observed during this month\'s arguments in the Mississippi case, helped ""prevent people from thinking that this Court is a political institution that will go back and forth depending on what part of the public yells loudest and ... will go back and forth depending on changes to the Court\'s membership."" But changes in the membership have now transformed America\'s highest court. As precedents dissolve, people can only guess where the court will go next. ', 'A 90-year-old was serving life for marijuana despite serious illness. Now he\'s going homeBy Casey Tolan, CNNUpdated 6:55 AM ET, Thu December 16, 2021  (CNN)In a dramatic reversal, a 90-year-old, seriously ill federal inmate serving life in prison for a nonviolent marijuana trafficking crime will go free after a judge granted him compassionate release on Tuesday -- overturning his previous order denying release. Horacio Estrada-Elias, who was the subject of a CNN investigative story in September, is set to be freed this week after more than a dozen years behind bars.""It\'s a huge blessing for all of us,"" his daughter Elizabeth Estrada said Tuesday. ""We\'re so excited for the whole family to finally be together.""Estrada-Elias suffers from congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease, and also contracted the coronavirus while in prison, according to court affidavits filed by doctors. His prison doctor predicted in April 2020 that he had ""less than 18 months"" to live, and his warden recommended release, noting his spotless disciplinary record and writing last year that ""he has been diagnosed with an incurable, progressive illness in which he will not recover."" Federal Judge Danny Reeves denied Estrada-Elias\' motion for compassionate release in July, arguing that a life sentence is ""the only sentence that would be appropriate."" Read MoreCompassionate release became a life-or-death lottery for thousands of federal inmates during the pandemic But last month, an appeals court ordered Reeves to reconsider. Two judges on a three-judge panel of the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals wrote that Reeves had ""abused (his) discretion"" by ignoring the fact that Estrada-Elias is unlikely to reoffend and ""overly emphasizing"" his nonviolent crimes. One judge dissented.On Tuesday, the day after the formal appeal mandate was transmitted to his court, Reeves issued a new opinion approving compassionate release. ""The defendant\'s medical condition constitutes an extraordinary and compelling reason for release... when considered in conjunction with the defendant\'s advanced age,"" Reeves wrote, reducing Estrada-Elias\' sentence to time served. Estrada said her father\'s lawyer had expected the judge would take longer to issue a new ruling, potentially requiring a hearing or legal briefings, but she guessed that ""something softened his heart.""Horacio Estrada-Elias in a 2014 family photo, with, from left to right, his sister Amanda Estrada, his sister Sylvia Ramirez, and his daughter Elizabeth Estrada. Now, Estrada-Elias will be released from prison in Minnesota and fly to the San Diego area on Friday, Estrada said. He\'ll live with his sister, and the family plans to set up a medical bed to take care of him at home.Reeves has an especially tough record on compassionate release, rejecting the vast majority of more than 100 release motions that came before him since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a CNN analysis of court records. In his earlier opinion, he had argued that the large volume of marijuana that Estrada-Elias trafficked had shown ""a flagrant disrespect for the law that can only be reflected in an equally severe sentence.""His reversal ""seems to be rooted in common sense and human dignity as opposed to legal formalities,"" said Alison Guernsey, a University of Iowa law professor who has studied compassionate release cases and reviewed Reeves\' opinion. She said it is uncommon for inmates who are denied compassionate release to win on appeal. A court staffer for Reeves, who was nominated to the bench by former President George W. Bush and serves as the chief judge in his district, declined an interview request for him.Estrada-Elias was sentenced to life in April 2008 after pleading guilty to a conspiracy to traffic tens of thousands of pounds of marijuana into and around the United States. Reeves, who handled his case, was required to give him a life sentence because he had previous drug convictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\n\n\n\nBut the mandatory minimum law that applied was taken off the books in 2018. If Estrada-Elias hadn\'t been subject to the mandatory minimum, the guideline for his sentence range would have been about 12 to 16 years in prison, according to court documents.Estrada-Elias\' case is an example of the wide disparities across the country in compassionate release during the pandemic. In 2020 and the first half of 2021, some federal courts granted more than 40 percent of compassionate release motions in their districts, while others granted less than 3 percent, according to data from the US Sentencing Commission -- even though judges in all of the districts are applying the same laws, which allow compassionate release in ""extraordinary and compelling"" cases.In Estrada-Elias\' district, the Eastern District of Kentucky, judges granted about 6% of compassionate release motions, the data shows. Guernsey, the law professor, said the vast disparity in grant rates between courts ""really calls into question the equity of compassionate release.""""It appears to depend not on the gravity of your medical condition or the type of extraordinary and compelling circumstances that will dictate whether you\'re released,"" she said, ""but almost a fluke of geography.""']","['US says no breakthrough in \'frank and forthright\' talks with Russia over Ukraine border crisisBy Jennifer Hansler, Jeremy Herb, Kylie Atwood, Natasha Bertrand and Rob Picheta, CNNUpdated 3:25 PM ET, Mon January 10, 2022 JUST WATCHEDJake Tapper presses Secretary Blinken on Russia and UkraineReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHJake Tapper presses Secretary Blinken on Russia and Ukraine 08:55Geneva, Switzerland (CNN)US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said she does not know yet whether Russia is prepared to de-escalate the situation with Ukraine following its massive build-up of Russian troops near Ukraine\'s border and fears of a possible invasion.Sherman met with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov on Monday in the first of three sets of bilateral talks slated for this week. She told reporters that the session was ""frank and forthright"" but that it is too soon to say whether the Kremlin was serious about diplomacy.""I don\'t think we know the answer to that,"" Sherman said when asked if the US got an indication that Russia is prepared to de-escalate on the Ukrainian border. ""We will see whether in fact Russia understands that the best way to pursue diplomacy is for them to reduce those tensions and to de-escalate.""The talks, which wrapped up Monday after more than seven hours in Geneva, Switzerland, follow months of tension near the Ukraine-Russia border, where more than 100,000 Russian soldiers have massed.Ryabkov told reporters after the meeting that despite American concerns about the Russian troop buildup along the Ukrainian border, Moscow had no intention of launching military action.Read More""We explained to our colleagues that we have no plans to attack,"" he said. ""All the combat trainings of troops are carried out within our national territory, and there is no reason to fear any escalation scenario in this regard.""Wendy Sherman (L) and Sergey Ryabkov (R) attend security talks on Monday in Geneva, Switzerland.Sherman said that the US ""certainly urged Russia to de-escalate"" adding: ""But we will see."" She said that the US did not set specific timelines for anything.Sherman said the US defines de-escalation as Russia returning its thousands of troops on the border with Ukraine to their barracks or explaining what exercises they are conducting and what their purposes are. The Russians told the US that the massing of troops on the border was not a precursor to an invasion, she said.""I don\'t think you\'d be surprised to hear that Russia indeed said to us as they said publicly, they do not intend to invade, these are just maneuvers and exercises,"" Sherman said. ""And they can prove that in fact they have no intention by deescalating and returning troops to barracks,"" she said.Week of high-stakes talksMonday\'s talks were the first of three sets of meetings on tap this week, with NATO talks with Russia on Wednesday in Brussels, followed by talks Thursday in Vienna between Russia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.The US and Russia had ""useful discussions"" on Monday, Sherman said, but they did not negotiate about specifics. Sherman said the US delegation pushed back on Russian proposals that were ""simply nonstarters,"" such as Russia\'s demand in the lead-up to this week\'s sessions that NATO pledge never to admit Ukraine, saying that ""we will not allow anyone to slam closed NATO\'s open-door policy."" Sherman again stressed the US would not have discussions about Ukraine or Europe without those partners in the room.Tensions are high on Ukraine\'s border with Russia. Here\'s what you need to knowRyabkov described the talks as ""businesslike"" and ""professional."" But he said no progress had been made when it came to NATO, where he reiterated Russia\'s demands for ""ironclad"" guarantees that NATO would not expand further east and would never admit Ukraine.""On the central question, on no expansion of NATO, my answer would be, would be a flat and plan no: No progress,"" Ryabkov said. ""And this is one of the major problems before. And I would say the rest depends, to a great extent, on what will happen further down the road on this, exactly on this issue.""Sherman said that the US delegation expressed openness to discussing the future of certain missile systems in Europe along the lines of the now-defunct Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, as well as ways that both sides could set ""reciprocal limits on the size and scope of military exercises"" and to improve transparency about those exercises.She noted that both the US and Russia understand that issues as complicated as arms control will take longer than a few days or weeks. Sherman said the US would have further conversations with the Russian government after the multilateral discussions this week.Deputy national security adviser Jon Finer told CNN\'s Jim Sciutto on Monday as the talks wrapped that he does not ""see a situation in which the US walks away"" from talks with Russia, even if Kremlin officials take positions during this week\'s discussions that are considered nonstarters by the US. ""Russia put out positions that are nonstarters and said other things we think maybe present some areas in which we can work to make progress, and we\'re going to find that out during the course of this week,"" Finer said.US quietly authorized $200 million in Ukraine aidIn late December, the Biden administration quietly authorized an additional $200 million in security assistance to Ukraine, according to four people familiar with the matter.The security package authorized the shipment of much of the same defensive equipment the US has provided in the past, including small arms and ammunition, secure radios, medical equipment, spare parts and other equipment. The package was authorized just weeks before the US and Russia were set to begin this week\'s talks.The administration quietly notified Congress of the new authorization earlier this month, two of the people said. Some officials found out about it though classified channels, two of the sources added. The equipment will likely take some time to deliver -- a delivery of $60 million worth of equipment authorized last summer is only now nearing completion, a State Department official told CNN. The State Department said that weaponry was delivered over the last few weeks and that assistance will continue, but declined to discuss specifics.""I\'m not going to get into every tranche and update of security assistance. The point is: we have given more security assistance to Ukraine in the last year than at any point since 2014. Those deliveries are ongoing, as recently as in the last few weeks, and there are more scheduled in the coming weeks,"" a State Department spokesperson said.By contrast, earlier the State Department has spoken to specific details surrounding the additional security assistance that was authorized. In this case the Biden administration appeared to want to keep this new package out of the limelight ahead this week\'s talks, two congressional sources said. The National Security Council referred CNN to the State and Defense departments for comment. The Pentagon did not respond to requests for comment. As of mid-December, the US had provided Ukraine with more than $450 million in security assistance, a White House official told CNN at the time. By the end of the year, the administration had delivered new Javelin missiles and Command Launch Units, Island Class Patrol Boats, first aid kits, secure radios, electronics, medical equipment, engines, generators, spare parts and other equipment, the official said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told ABC on Sunday that the administration had continued to provide defensive assistance to Ukraine ""as recently as the last couple of weeks"" and that ""if there is further aggression by Russia against Ukraine, we\'ll see even more of that.""  One source familiar with the assistance said that it is not a game-changer and would not be enough to serve as a major impediment to a Russian invasion. The Ukrainians have made clear to the US that they want more security assistance -- beyond the kinds of defensive weaponry already provided, the source explained. Breakthrough unlikelyThe global community will be closely following the discussions, which have been billed as a late attempt to avert a war on Europe\'s eastern flank. Still, Blinken played down the prospects of a breakthrough on the eve of the talks. ""It\'s hard to see making actual progress, as opposed to talking, in an atmosphere of escalation with a gun to Ukraine\'s head. So, if we\'re actually going to make progress, we\'re going to have to see de-escalation, Russia pulling back from the threat that it currently poses to Ukraine,"" Blinken said on CNN\'s ""State of the Union"" on Sunday.""We\'re here because repeatedly over the last decade, Russia has committed acts of aggression against neighbors -- Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine in 2014, and now the renewed threat about Ukraine today,"" he added. The West has a rare window to put Putin in his place""It\'s also not about making concessions. It\'s about seeing whether, in the context of dialogue and diplomacy, there are things that both sides, all sides can do to reduce tensions,"" Blinken said.On Sunday, Sherman and Ryabkov held a dinner that was ""difficult but business-like"" ahead of Monday\'s formal session, Ryabkov told state news agency RIA Novosti.The State Department readout of the dinner said Sherman ""stressed the United States\' commitment to the international principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the freedom of sovereign nations to choose their own alliances.""As many as 100,000 Russian troops have remained gathered near the Ukrainian border, despite warnings from US President Joe Biden and European leaders of serious consequences should Putin move ahead with an invasion. And US intelligence findings estimated last month that Russia could begin a military offensive in Ukraine ""as soon as early 2022.""Biden told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call earlier this month that the US and its allies ""will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine.""CNN\'s Mick Krever, Nic Robertson and Alex Marquardt and contributed reporting.', '', 'Biden raises concerns with Ethiopia\'s Abiy over Tigray air strikes, urges ceasefire By Ivana Kottasová and Sugam Pokharel, CNNUpdated 3:04 PM ET, Mon January 10, 2022 JUST WATCHEDBlinken warns Ethiopia could be on a \'path to destruction\'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBlinken warns Ethiopia could be on a \'path to destruction\' 04:21 (CNN)US President Joe Biden spoke with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on Monday, raising concerns over air strikes in Ethiopia\'s northern Tigray region and urging the leader of Africa\'s second most populous country to negotiate a ceasefire after 14 months of war.The call comes just nine days after the US formally terminated Ethiopia from its trade program with sub-Saharan African countries over human rights violations.Ethiopia is at war with itself.

Follow him @DeanObeidallah. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. This piece has been updated to reflect the latest news. (CNN)""The United States is coming to an end. The question is how."" Those are the jarring opening lines of Canadian author Stephen Marche\'s new book, ""The Next Civil War: Dispatches from the American Future."" Released the same week as the anniversary of the January 6 attack on our Capitol that signaled how dangerous our political polarization has become, Marche\'s book shares different scenarios of how the United States could collapse. Dean ObeidallahMarche isn\'t the only Canadian worried about their southern neighbor\'s future. Just days before Marche\'s book released, political scientist Thomas Homer-Dixon -- the executive director of the Cascade Institute, which focuses on ways to address threats to society -- penned a powerful op-ed in Canada\'s ""Globe and Mail"" that begins with a similar warning. ""By 2025, American democracy could collapse, causing extreme domestic political instability, including widespread civil violence,"" Homer-Dixon writes. ""By 2030, if not sooner,"" he adds, ""the country could be governed by a right-wing dictatorship.""  As Americans, our first instinct when a person from outside of the US says something critical of our nation is often to dismiss the comment (or mock their country; be honest!). In this case, though, neither Marche nor Homer-Dixon wrote their words to belittle America or to make Canadians feel better about their country. In fact, as Marche explained on my SiriusXM radio show last week, it\'s the opposite: Marche wrote his book because he ""loves"" the US after working and living within its borders off and on for years. His hope, he says, is to warn Americans of where the nation is going before it\'s too late.The question the GOP must answer about January 6In the case of Homer-Dixon, the warning is even more unnerving because the column is addressed not to Americans but to his fellow Canadians, to prepare them for what may be heading their way if America\'s democracy does collapse. Homer-Dixon bluntly cautions his compatriots: ""A terrible storm is coming from the south, and Canada is woefully unprepared."" Read MoreWhen Canadians start to counsel one another on the threat posed to American democracy, you know we\'re in a dire position. This is not about scoring political points; rather, it emanates from a place of sincere concern for their own nation.  It\'s a sobering reminder that if our democratic republic ends it will have repercussions not just for our nation but the world -- from bolstering autocratic leaders, such as the type that former President Donald Trump had praised, to undermining Western democracies. Homer-Dixon\'s words carry real weight: As he says, for more than 40 years he\'s studied the causes of war, revolution and social breakdown. ""Today,"" he wrote to his countrymen and women, ""as I watch the unfolding crisis in the United States, I see a political and social landscape flashing with warning signals."" You can\'t troll the President with \'Let\'s go, Brandon\' and then play the victimTo those who might view his premonitions as over the top, Homer-Dixon adds, ""We mustn\'t dismiss these possibilities just because they seem ludicrous or too horrible to imagine. In 2014, the suggestion that Donald Trump would become president would also have struck nearly everyone as absurd."" (Point taken with that one!)This scholar of violent conflict highlights the range of factors currently plaguing the US and contributing to our institutions\' vulnerability, from growing income inequality to demographic change that has caused some ""right-wing ideologues"" to inflame ""fears that traditional US culture is being erased and Whites are being \'replaced."" (Fox News\' Tucker Carlson has long been peddling this ""replacement theory"" -- although he\'s denied that\'s what he\'s doing -- and he\'s been rightfully denounced. And at least one other GOP elected official, Rep. Matt Gaetz, has joined him, claiming Democrats are ""importing new voters"" from other countries. As with Carlson, Gaetz insisted his views had nothing to do with race.) Homer-Dixon even believes that using the ""F word"" -- fascism -- to describe the state of the GOP is accurate, citing the perspective of Canadian-American conservative David Frum: ""Trumpism increasingly resembles European fascism in its contempt for the rule of law and glorification of violence."" I couldn\'t agree more.But what truly resonates with me is Homer-Dixon\'s assessment that the ""underpinning"" of our politics ""is a vital set of beliefs and values,"" and ""if a substantial enough fraction of a population no longer holds those beliefs and values, then democracy can\'t survive.""  This is the revelation America is still waiting forAlarmingly, a recent NPR/Ipsos poll found that two-thirds of Republicans agree with the demonstrably false statement that ""voter fraud helped Joe Biden win the 2020 election."" Fewer than half of Republicans, the poll found, agree that they are willing to accept the election\'s proven results. How can we have a functioning democratic republic when one side apparently believes that only elections they win are ""legitimate""? The fact so many Republicans reject the results of the 2020 election was likely part of the motivation behind this memorable line in President Joe Biden\'s speech one year following the January 6 attack: ""You can\'t love your country only when you win.""For Homer-Dixon, all of this adds up to a crucial question for his country: How can Canadians prepare for the worst? For one, he says, ""We need to start by fully recognizing the magnitude of the danger."" He continues, ""If Mr. Trump is re-elected"" and ushers in a right-wing authoritarian regime, ""The risks to our country in their cumulative effect could easily be existential, far greater than any in our federation\'s history."" For example, he theorizes, ""What happens ... if high-profile political refugees fleeing persecution arrive in our country, and the U.S. regime demands them back. Do we comply?"" Biden just threw down the democracy gauntletTo prepare for that kind of possible scenario, he implores Canada\'s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to ""immediately convene"" a committee with representatives from the various political parties in government who ""should receive regular intelligence analyses and briefings by Canadian experts on political and social developments in the United States and their implications for democratic failure there.""  There\'s been a lot of talk lately by American leaders on the threat posed to our democracy by today\'s GOP. Former President Jimmy Carter wrote an op-ed for the New York Times titled, ""I fear for our democracy,"" raising concerns that since the January 6 attack, ""promoters of the lie that the election was stolen have taken over one political party and stoked distrust in our electoral systems.""Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion\'s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookBut there\'s something deeply compelling about reading the words of Canadians who have no skin in the game of American politics to offer such blunt words and warnings about the red flags they are seeing. As Marche details in his book, there are Americans who hold a ""desperate faith in their country\'s institutions that amounts nearly to delusion."" These Canadians are warning us to break free of those delusions and instead understand that ""it"" can happen here -- with ""it"" being anything from fascism to a civil war that would collapse our democracy -- and to get a grasp on this reality before it\'s too late.', '', 'Who\'s to blame for inflation?

They\'re worried about what\'s nextConsumer prices rose at the fastest pace since 1982Rural Americans have fewer options to offset inflationNew York (CNN Business)President Joe Biden and other politicians will tell you inflation is Corporate America\'s fault. Corporate America blames the administration\'s pandemic assistance programs for putting too much cash into the economy. The reality, economists say, is that it\'s all of those things. And more. Whichever of the two main inflation gauges you read — the Consumer Price Index or the Fed-preferred Personal Consumption Expenditures price index -— the verdict is the same: inflation has soared to a nearly four-decade high. Of course, inflation isn\'t inherently a bad thing. In the United States, for the past 40 years or so, we\'ve been living with an ideal low-and-slow level of inflation that comes with a well-oiled consumer-driven economy, where prices go up around 2% a year, if that. The current surge in prices reflects an economy roaring back to its fighting weight. What concerns economists and policymakers is when prices keep rising, and when wages don\'t rise in kind. Although wages broadly are also going up, they so far haven\'t kept pace with the rising costs of food, energy, housing and everyday consumer goods. People are, understandably, frustrated. Although there\'s no one single culprit to blame, here are some of the forces — Covid-19, greedy businesses, the supply chain crisis, the government — you can take your rage out on. Read MoreThe pandemicThis is an easy one. The pandemic upended everything about our lives, and when the world shut down in the spring of 2020, it was like pulling the plug on the global economy.  But by that summer, demand for consumer goods started to rebound. Big time. Congress and President Biden passed an historic $1.9 trillion stimulus bill in March that put cash directly in Americans\' wallets. And rather than spending money on travel or dining out, we spent on stuff. Lots and lots of it.Demand went from zero to 100, but supplies couldn\'t bounce back so easily. Factories were on lockdown or navigating Covid-19 restrictions, and raw materials were harder to get because of the sudden swell in demand. Shortages of just about everything cropped up, especially workers to unload goods and drive them to their destination. We\'re still untangling the mess at ports around the world.Corporate America It can feel morally satisfying and politically convenient to blame Corporate America. After all, profit margins are up across industries even as the costs of production have hit record highs. About two-thirds of the largest publicly traded US companies reported fatter profit margins in the first nine months of 2021 compared with the same period in 2020, according to the Wall Street Journal. In other words, even as costs for raw materials, labor and transportation have increased in response to the pandemic, a lot big corporations are offsetting those costs by raising prices on consumers.Analysts say it\'s almost impossible to verify how much consumer price increases reflect rising production costs versus a desire to juice profits, but companies aren\'t exactly hiding their price flexes. In fact, some are even on record bragging about their ""pricing power"" — corporate-speak for sticking customers with a bigger bill.Democrats and consumer advocates are calling these companies out. Last month, Senator Elizabeth Warren blasted Hertz for spending $2 billion on a stock buyback — a common but controversial way to reward shareholders — rather than investing its excess cash in rebuilding its fleet, which could bring down record-high prices for consumers. Although there\'s some truth to the argument that corporations are making inflation worse, there is a bigger structural problem underpinning the issue: For decades, lax antitrust enforcement has put the concentration of economic power in the hands of a few giants. ""Viewed this way, the underlying problem isn\'t inflation per se. It\'s lack of competition,"" wrote Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, in a recent op-ed for the Guardian. ""Corporations are using the excuse of inflation to raise prices and make fatter profits."" The Biden AdministrationRepublicans have been hammering Democrats and the Biden White House on inflation. After November\'s CPI came in at 6.8%, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell wasted no time pointing fingers. ""It is unthinkable that Senate Democrats would try to respond to this inflation report by ramming through another massive socialist spending package in a matter of days,"" he tweeted. It\'s true that government spending boosts inflation, but economists have pushed back on the idea that Biden\'s ambitious social safety net expansion would inflame price surges. ""Worries that the plan will ignite undesirably high inflation and an overheating economy are overdone,"" Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody\'s Analytics, said in July. Moody\'s analysts noted that government spending on items such as rental housing for low-income Americans, reducing prescription drug costs and making childcare more affordable is aimed at cooling off prices and easing shortages.Republicans blaming inflation on Biden are also conveniently forgetting the trillions of dollars in spending passed in 2020 that was supported by Republicans and signed by then-President Donald Trump, which economists say have also contributed to inflation.The FedMoney has essentially been free for the past two years, thanks to the Fed\'s double-barrel shotgun approach to economic stimulus — interest rates near zero and a massive investment in bonds that keeps yields near rock-bottom. That stimulus has staved off a lot of financial and economic pain, and was always meant to be temporary. But for months the Fed brushed off inflation concerns, vaguely dubbing price surges ""transitory"" before that word became almost comically devoid of meaning. Now, the Fed is finally tapping the brakes. The central bank said last month it would wrap up its stimulus program faster than originally announced, and its updated economic projections show multiple interest rate increases in 2022.', 'The Maldonado family travels by boat to their home after it flooded during Hurricane Ida on August 31, 2021, in Barataria, Louisiana.\'Off the charts\': Weather disasters have cost the US $750 billion over past 5 yearsBy Rachel Ramirez, CNNGraphics by CNN\'s John Keefe and Priya KrishnakumarUpdated 11:00 AM ET, Mon January 10, 2022 (CNN)A historic deep freeze that crippled Texas. A deadly hurricane that wreaked havoc from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast. A record-shattering heat wave and historic drought in the West. And a devastating, out-of-season tornado outbreak that tore through towns in the Central and Southern US. Those are just a handful of the 20 weather and climate disasters the United States experienced in 2021 that cost at least $1 billion each, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. When taken together, billion-dollar disasters carried an incredible economic toll of $145 billion last year.""2021 was, in essence, watching the climate projections of the past come true,"" Rachel Licker, a senior climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, told CNN. ""The fingerprints of climate change were all over many of the billion-dollar events that hit the US this year.""\n\nLast year was the second consecutive year with 20 or more billion-dollar disasters, something that had never occurred before 2020\'s record-breaking 22. But the price tag in 2021 was $50 billion more and the extreme weather was far more deadly. At least 688 people died in the 20 events last year, NOAA reports, which was more than double the death toll of 2020.An existential threat runs into political realities of US democracyRead More""What\'s concerning about 2021 is it\'s yet another year in a series of years where we have both a high frequency, high cost and a large diversity of these extreme events that affect people\'s lives and livelihoods,"" Adam Smith, a climatologist with NOAA who led the report, told CNN. ""Over the last five years, the United States has experienced almost $750 billion of damages from these billion-dollar disasters, which is really off the charts,"" he said. ""And 2022 may not be any different.""Smith points to a spate of factors that are contributing to the growing economic toll, including a rise in population and assets in harm\'s way and increased vulnerability given where and how structures are built. And, he said, climate change is ""amplifying and making more severe some of these extremes that lead to billion-dollar disasters.""Separate climate bill not being seriously considered in Senate, despite Manchin\'s support of the measuresPresident Joe Biden in April pledged to slash planet-warming fossil fuel emissions in the US. Democrats\' Build Back Better package contains $555 billion in climate and clean energy provisions that analysts say would significantly cut emissions and ultimately result in fewer and less-extreme climate disasters. That funding -- designed to be applied over the course of 10 years -- pales in comparison to what the US is now spending on disasters.As negotiations over that bill drag on in the Senate and global temperature continues its alarming rise, Licker said 2021 showed us that rapid and robust changes are necessary to limit the number of billion-dollar disasters that will strike the US in the future. ""We\'ve known about these risks for so long, it didn\'t have to be this way,"" she said. ""Hopefully 2021 and NOAA\'s new report will serve as a wake-up call for decision-makers across the country. While the time to act was yesterday, we can still make meaningful changes to the course that we\'re on.""\n\nNOAA\'s annual report only captures the most costly disasters and serves as a snapshot to quantify the toll of extreme weather and climate change across the US. The report accounts for roughly 80 to 85% of direct economic damages for all US disasters at all scales and loss levels, according to Smith. Hurricane Ida was the costliest extreme-weather event of 2021, NOAA found, totaling $75 billion and ranking among the top five most expensive US hurricanes on record since 1980. Additionally, the historic cold snap that plunged deep into Texas in February was the country\'s costliest winter storm on record, exacting a toll of $24 billion. People charge their cell phones and warm up inside a vehicle near Austin, Texas, during the 2021 deep freeze.NOAA also reported Monday that the average temperature in the US last year was 55 degrees, making 2021 the fourth-warmest year since record-keeping began 127 years ago. Precipitation was slightly above average in 2021, but drought conditions -- particularly in the West -- remained steady and significant throughout the year.Scientists have found climate change is not just increasing the severity of extreme weather -- it is interrupting typical patterns and causing wild swings between dry and wet extremes. After months of prolonged drought, California was hammered by extreme rain in so-called atmospheric river events that caused destructive flooding during the last couple of months of the year.The Beckwourth Complex Fire burned more than 100,000 acres and razed dozens of structures and homes in Northern California before it was contained in September.December is typically a quiet month for extreme weather, but a stunning number of extreme weather events -- all of which are more typical of warmer seasons -- stretched into the last month of the year, including the deadly tornado outbreak on December 10, the derecho and tornado outbreak on December 15, and the Marshall Fire in Colorado in the last week of the year.The ice shelf holding back the \'Doomsday glacier\' could shatter within the next five years, scientists warnSmith said although it is included in the 2021 report, the Marshall fire was such a big event that ""it may not be fully captured.""""The third most costly disaster in 2021 was the Western wildfires, in excess of $10 billion,"" Smith said. ""And with these late-year events, like what happened in Colorado, we\'ll probably have to up that even further in our first-quarter analysis this spring.""As in the US, extremes are becoming more frequent and more intense around the world due to the climate crisis.A recent report by the World Meteorological Organization found that an extreme weather event or climate disaster had occurred every day on average somewhere in the world over the last 50 years, a five-fold increase in frequency over that period. Globally, the economic toll of these disasters has climbed seven-fold since the 1970s, the WMO reported.The 20 billion-dollar disasters of 2021Hurricane Ida, August 29-September 1: $75 billionWinter storm and Texas deep freeze, February 10-19: $24 billionWestern wildfires: $10.6 billionWest drought and June heat wave: $8.9 billionTornado outbreak and severe weather, December 10: $3.9 billionTexas and Oklahoma severe weather, April 27-28: $3.3 billionSoutheast tornadoes and severe weather, March 24-25: $1.8 billionMidwest derecho and tornado outbreak, December 15: $1.8 billionOhio Valley hail storms, June 17-18: $1.7 billionTexas hail storms, April 12-15: $1.5 billionEastern severe weather, March 27-28: $1.4 billionLouisiana flooding, May 17-18: $1.4 billionSouthern tornadoes, severe weather, May 2-4: $1.3 billionCentral US severe storms, June 24-26: $1.3 billionNorth and Central US severe weather, August 10-13: $1.3 billionTropical Storm Fred, August 16-18: $1.3 billionCalifornia flooding and severe weather, January 24-29: $1.2 billionTropical Storm Elsa, July 7-9: $1.2 billionCentral US severe storms, July 8-11: $1.1 billionHurricane Nicholas, September 14-18: $1 billion', 'Tensions are high on Ukraine\'s border with Russia.

Western powers have repeatedly warned Russia in recent weeks against further aggressive moves against Ukraine.The Kremlin denies it is planning to attack and argues that NATO support for Ukraine -- including increased weapons supplies and military training -- constitutes a growing threat on Russia\'s western flank.The picture is complicated -- but here\'s a breakdown of what we know.What\'s the situation on the border?Read MoreThe United States and NATO have described the movements and concentrations of troops in and around Ukraine as ""unusual.""As many as 100,000 Russian troops have remained amassed at the Ukrainian border, despite warnings from US President Joe Biden and European leaders of serious consequences should Putin move ahead with an invasion. And US intelligence findings have estimated that Russia could begin a military offensive in Ukraine ""as soon as early 2022.""In late 2021, satellite photos revealed Russian hardware -- including self-propelled guns, battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles -- on the move at a training ground roughly 186 miles (300 km) from the border. But little other information has been made public to back up the allegation by Western powers of an increased threat.Satellite photos raise concerns of Russian military build-up near UkraineMany of Russia\'s military bases are to the west of the vast country -- the direction from which history suggests any threats are most likely to come. Russia\'s Defense Ministry said on December 1 that it had started ""regular"" winter military drills in its southern region, parts of which border Ukraine. The exercises involve more than 10,000 troops, the ministry said.Meanwhile, Ukraine\'s eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions bordering Russia, an area known as Donbas, have been under the control of Russian-backed separatists since 2014. Russian forces are also present in the area, referred to by Ukraine as ""temporarily occupied territories,"" although Russia denies it.The front lines of the conflict have barely moved in five years, but there are frequent small-scale clashes and sniper attacks. Russia was angered when Ukrainian forces deployed a Turkish-made combat drone for the first time in October to strike a position held by the pro-Russian separatists.Russia also has forces numbering in the tens of thousands at its massive naval base in Crimea, the Ukrainian territory it annexed in 2014. The Crimean peninsula, which lies to the south of the rest of Ukraine, is now connected by a road bridge to mainland Russia.A member of the Ukrainian Armed Forces takes part in military drills at a training ground near the border with Russian-annexed Crimea in Kherson region, Ukraine, on November 17, 2021. What\'s the history of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia?Tensions between Ukraine and Russia, both former Soviet states, escalated in late 2013 over a landmark political and trade deal with the European Union. After the pro-Russian then-President, Viktor Yanukovych, suspended the talks -- reportedly under pressure from Moscow -- weeks of protests in Kiev erupted into violence.Then, in March 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, an autonomous peninsula in southern Ukraine with strong Russian loyalties, on the pretext that it was defending its interests and those of Russian-speaking citizens. First, thousands of Russian-speaking troops, dubbed ""little green men"" and later acknowledged by Moscow to be Russian soldiers, poured into the Crimean peninsula. Within days, Russia completed its annexation in a referendum that was slammed by Ukraine and most of the world as illegitimate.Russian soldiers patrol the area surrounding the Ukrainian military unit in Perevalnoye, outside Simferopol, Crimea, on March 20, 2014.Shortly afterwards, pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine\'s Donetsk and Luhansk regions declared their independence from Kiev, prompting months of heavy fighting. Despite Kiev and Moscow signing a peace deal in Minsk in 2015, brokered by France and Germany, there have been repeated ceasefire violations. According to UN figures, there have been more than 3,000 conflict-related civilian deaths in eastern Ukraine since March 2014.The European Union and US have imposed a series of measures in response to Russia\'s actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, including economic sanctions targeting individuals, entities and specific sectors of the Russian economy. The Kremlin accuses Ukraine of stirring up tensions in the country\'s east and of violating the Minsk ceasefire agreement.Ukrainian soldiers prepare to support the withdrawal of troops on February 19, 2015 in Artemivsk, Ukraine.What\'s Russia\'s view?The Kremlin has repeatedly denied that Russia plans on invading Ukraine, insisting Russia does not pose a threat to anyone and that the country moving troops across its own territory should not be cause for alarm.Moscow sees the growing support for Ukraine from NATO -- in terms of weaponry, training and personnel -- as a threat to its own security. It has also accused Ukraine of boosting its own troop numbers in preparation for an attempt to retake the Donbas region, an allegation Ukraine has denied.Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for specific legal agreements that would rule out any further NATO expansion eastwards towards Russia\'s borders, saying the West has not lived up to its previous verbal assurances.

""External military pressure goes hand in hand with domestic destabilization of the country,"" he said.Tensions between the two countries have been exacerbated by a deepening Ukrainian energy crisis that Kiev believes Moscow has purposefully provoked.At the same time, Zelensky\'s government faces challenges on many fronts. The government\'s popularity has stagnated amid multiple domestic political challenges, including a third wave of Covid-19 infections in recent weeks and a struggling economy.Many people are also unhappy that the government hasn\'t yet delivered on benefits it promised and ended the conflict in the country\'s east. Anti-government protests have taken place in Kiev.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky makes a speech during his visit to a frontline in Ukraine\'s Donbas region on October 14, 2021.What does NATO say?NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said ""there will be a high price to pay for Russia"" if it once again invades Ukraine, a NATO partner.""We have a wide range of options: economic sanctions, financial sanctions, political restrictions,"" said Stoltenberg, in a December 1 interview with CNN.After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, NATO increased its defenses ""with combat-ready battlegroups in the eastern part of the alliance, in the Baltic countries, in Latvia ... but also in the Black Sea region,"" Stoltenberg said.Britain\'s army chief warns risk of accidental war with Russia is greater than during Cold WarUkraine is not a NATO member, and therefore doesn\'t have the same security guarantees as NATO members.But Stoltenberg left the possibility of Ukraine becoming a NATO member on the table, saying that Russia does not have the right to tell Ukraine that it cannot pursue NATO membership.NATO was set to hold crunch talks with Russia on January 12 in Geneva, following discussions with diplomats from Ukraine and the US, in an attempt to avert an invasion.Stoltenberg said on January 10 that Moscow still had ""tens of thousands of combat ready troops"" close the border with Ukraine, but welcomed the Kremlin\'s willingness to meet. What does the United States say?President Joe Biden told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a January 2022 phone call that the US and its allies ""will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine.""The two spoke just a few days after Biden urged Putin to ease the crisis on the border, and before Russian and US officials are set to meet in person in Geneva later this month.Two defense officials told CNN on January 3 that the Defense Department has developed military options for Biden if he decides to increase capabilities in eastern Europe to further deter potential Russian aggression against Ukraine. Both officials emphasized that this part of routine planning the military does and that for now, the focus remains on diplomacy and potential economic sanctions.US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov held meetings in Geneva on January 10, as the US sought to de-escalate the threat of a Russian advance.US considering sending extra weaponry to Ukraine as fears mount over potential Russian invasionSecretary of State Antony Blinken has also warned Russia that ""any renewed aggression can trigger serious consequences.""The US delivered roughly $450 million in security assistance to Ukraine in 2021, the Pentagon said, including a package of small arms and ammunition in December. The Biden administration has also weighed sending military advisers and new equipment, including more substantial weaponry, to Ukraine to prepare for a possible invasion, sources familiar with the deliberations told CNN in November. The Obama administration was taken by surprise when Russia invaded Crimea in 2014 and backed an insurgency in eastern Ukraine\'s Donbas region. US officials say they are determined not to be caught out by another Russian military operation.""Our concern is that Russia may make a serious mistake of attempting to rehash what it undertook back in 2014, when it amassed forces along the border, crossed into sovereign Ukrainian territory and did so claiming falsely that it was provoked,"" Blinken said in November.Armored personnel carriers take part in an exercise in amphibious landing held by army corps and naval infantry units of the Russian Black Sea Fleet at the Opuk range, Crimea, on October 18, 2021.What other factors are at play?Unrest in the former Soviet state of Kazakhstan was unwelcome news for Putin at the beginning of 2022. Deadly protests in early January saw the Kazakh government resign, a state of emergency declared and troops from a Russia-led military alliance deployed to help contain the unrest.But experts have warned that Russia\'s intervention is unlikely to be the end of the story. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that ""once Russians are in your house, sometimes it is very difficult to get them to leave.""Another issue revolves around energy supply. Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline -- connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany -- as a threat to its own security.Nord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine.Kiev views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against an invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe.Analysts and US lawmakers have raised concerns that Nord Stream 2 will increase European dependence on Russian gas and could allow Moscow to selectively target countries such as Ukraine with energy cut-offs, without broader disruption to European supplies. Bypassing eastern European countries also means those nations would be deprived of lucrative transit fees Russia would otherwise pay.In May 2021, the Biden administration waived sanctions on the company behind Nord Stream 2, effectively giving it the green light. US officials say the move was in the interest of US national security as it sought to rebuild frayed relations with Germany.In November, the US imposed new sanctions on a Russian-linked entity and a vessel linked to Nord Stream 2. Some US senators have called for further sanctions to be imposed to prevent Russia using the pipeline as a weapon; Ukraine too has called for tougher measures.CNN\'s Matthew Chance reported from Kiev and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

Greenhouse gas emissions from coal increased in 2021 for the first time in seven years, according to Rhodium Group. (CNN)In a troublesome sign for President Joe Biden\'s climate goals, US greenhouse emissions surged back from a pandemic slump faster in 2021 than the overall economy, according to a preliminary analysis by the nonpartisan Rhodium Group. Energy analysts had expected to see a rebound of planet-warming emissions in 2021. But even so, the growth outpaced expectations, according to Kate Larsen, a partner at Rhodium Group and a co-author of the report. ""Emissions grew even faster than the economic recovery and that was largely the rebound in coal generation,"" Larsen told CNN, noting that ""there weren\'t any significant policies to make economic growth less carbon-intensive.""\n\nPreliminary 2021 data from Rhodium estimates economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions increased 6.2% compared to 2020 -- which saw a steep drop in emissions due to the Covid-19 economic shutdown. Still, 2021 emissions remained 5% below 2019 levels.The last 7 years have been the warmest on record as planet approaches critical thresholdCoal use was a big driver of the rebound in emissions, according to the Rhodium report. Coal burned for electricity spiked 17% in 2021, the first year since 2014 that coal generation in the US increased instead of decreasing. Larsen said the switch back to coal was largely due to increasing natural gas prices; natural gas generation dropped 3% in 2021 as prices rose.  Read MoreLarsen said that ""because of a lack of federal rules and standards,"" changes in emissions ""are largely at the whim of energy market dynamics."" ""We saw that major uptick in coal generation -- the first increase in coal generation since 2014 -- and that was largely because natural gas was so expensive and there was no backstop from allowing coal rebounding,"" she said.  A bad year for Biden\'s climate goalThe growth in US emissions is bad news for Biden\'s overarching climate goal: a deadline of 2030 to cut fossil fuel emissions in half from 2005 levels. Climate and energy experts, including Larsen, widely agree that these emissions cuts won\'t happen at the current economic trajectory -- they need policy changes to occur. Experts consider 2020 a bit of an anomaly; emissions fell significantly because Covid-19 ground economic growth to a halt for months. While Larsen and others are certainly not calling for economic growth to slow in the future, they say Biden needs to see a lot more years like 2020 in terms of emissions output.  ""We need to repeat 2020 in terms of emission reductions while achieving economic growth,"" Larsen said. ""We really need to escalate annual emissions reductions; we can\'t have any more years of emissions growth."" \n\nWorld Resources Institute senior associate Devashree Saha -- who was not involved in the Rhodium report -- told CNN their 2021 US emissions estimates ""are not very surprising"" and agreed there needs to be significant policy changes to make a dent.  ""Under a business-as-usual scenario with all the climate policies you have today at the federal, state and local level -- if we don\'t have any additional policy, the outlook by 2030 is we would only get to 31% emission reductions"" from 2005 levels, Saha said.  Saha added that a significant policy change is needed to make progress on US emissions. For instance, if Biden\'s Build Back Better Act and its $555 billion worth of climate and clean energy provisions passed Congress, the World Resources Institute estimated the US could reduce its emissions by 43% by 2030. Separate climate bill not being seriously considered in Senate, despite Manchin\'s support of the measures""The policies included in the Build Back Better Act are really our best bet,"" Saha said. The package is currently stalled in the Senate, after West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin announced last month he wouldn\'t support it. Still, Manchin has signaled a clear willingness to work on the climate portion of the bill, saying Tuesday that it\'s ""one we probably can come to an agreement on much easier than anything else.""  Manchin, who represents a coal-producing state, has already shaped the clean energy provisions in the bill to be more carrot and less stick -- cutting out a clean electricity program and objecting to a fee for methane leaks. Larsen said ideally, US climate policy would contain a measure of carrots and sticks to get the steepest emissions reductions.

', 'Biden confronts challenges to democracy at home and abroad this weekAnalysis by Stephen Collinson, CNNUpdated 12:18 AM ET, Mon January 10, 2022 JUST WATCHEDBlinken rules out pulling back US troops, restricting NATO in Russia talks ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBlinken rules out pulling back US troops, restricting NATO in Russia talks  02:25 (CNN)President Joe Biden\'s fresh vow to save democracy faces an immediate test at home and abroad this week, with a long-shot voting rights push and the most critical US diplomacy with Russia since the Cold War.With his forceful speech on the anniversary of the January 6 insurrection last week, Biden appeared to engineer a political pivot, putting his credibility on the line to pass new laws rolling back Republican state voter suppression bills and restoring minority voting rights. He will travel to Atlanta, a city synonymous with the civil rights movement, on Tuesday, to try to dislodge the ""dagger"" he suggested ex-President Donald Trump and his Republican Party are holding ""at the throat of our democracy."" But to be successful, Biden must find a way to overcome the roadblock that has so far also derailed his social spending and climate agenda -- opposition to amending Senate filibuster rules among moderate Democrats including Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. Republicans in key battleground states renew efforts to write new rules for future elections and sow doubts about the last oneBiden\'s administration is also locked in consequential work overseas, with a flurry of talks with Russia amid US warnings that President Vladimir Putin may be poised to invade a young democracy -- Ukraine. The Kremlin is using its former satellite state as a pawn in a gambit aimed at driving NATO out of Eastern European democracies that were once within its Cold War orbit. US efforts to convince Russia to stand down will have huge implications for the geopolitical situation in Europe. And Biden\'s tussle for influence with Putin is all the more ironic since the Russian leader is not only threatening democracy across the Atlantic. He is accused by US intelligence of interfering in US elections to help Trump, the ex-President who eventually sought to deny the will of voters in 2020 by attempting a coup and who often genuflected toward the Russian leader. The talks in Europe, and Biden\'s capacity to unlock the voting rights puzzle in Washington, will be a marker of his presidential clout as he tries to bounce back after a rough political patch. The stakes of the voting rights initiative is huge, testing Democrats\' ability to protect access to the franchise, especially for minority voters, which is under threat from GOP-led legislatures inspired by Trump\'s lies. And the two-front administration push will go a long way toward deciding the outcome in the US and internationally of a presidency Biden has dedicated to safeguarding the global democracy that he says is under mortal threat.A full bore push for voting rightsRead MoreVoting rights has often seemed less of a priority than other Biden agenda items in a first year in power dominated by the pandemic and ambitious spending proposals, including the bipartisan infrastructure law that passed and the stalled social safety net bill.But both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Atlanta to build support for the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The first bill would make Election Day a public holiday, mandate same-day voter registration and allow all voters to request mail-in ballots, among other provisions. It would also reverse partisan takeovers of election administration contained in some recent GOP legislation in the states. The latter bill would restore federal government oversight of state voting laws gutted by the Supreme Court in a 2013 decision. Since Republicans universally oppose the Freedom to Vote Act and only one of their senators, Alaska\'s Lisa Murkowski, backs the measure named for civil rights hero and late Democratic Rep. John Lewis, Democrats must get around Republican use of the filibuster that requires a supermajority of 60 votes to pass most major legislation. But Manchin of West Virginia and Sinema of Arizona have been reluctant to water down filibuster rules.Senate Democrats vow they\'ll pass voting rights legislation with or without Republicans. Here\'s what their proposals would doMany Democrats are pleading with them to relent, arguing that a cascade of voter suppression laws passed by Republican-run states represents an existential threat to free and fair elections that can only be reversed by federal action in what may be the waning months of Democratic power before midterm elections in November.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, has vowed to hold a vote by Martin Luther King Jr. Day -- a week from Monday -- if Republicans do not yield. Supporters of the legislation are pushing for a limited filibuster opt-out for a voting rights overhaul and are trying to get Manchin on board -- especially given that he wrote the Freedom to Vote Act himself, after Republicans balked at an earlier bill that contained more sweeping reforms.""He pulled it together and they\'re still refusing to support it, so he has all the cover he needs to now step away and do what we need done, and that is provide the 49th vote and I hope that the 50th vote will come along,"" House Majority Whip James Clyburn said on CNN\'s ""Newsroom"" on Saturday.Speaking to Fox\'s Bret Baier on Sunday, the South Carolina Democrat increased the pressure on Manchin. He said he agreed with Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren that the Senate filibuster had ""deep roots in racism"" and should not be allowed to cement a veto for the minority.Manchin last week dealt a blow to the hopes of voting reform advocates like Clyburn, a key figure in rescuing Biden\'s then-languishing presidential campaign in early 2020 and an important ambassador to Black voters.""I\'ve always been for rules being done the way we\'ve always done, two-thirds of the members voting,"" Manchin indicated to CNN\'s Jake Tapper. He warned that getting rid of the filibuster would hurt Democrats if Republicans win back control of the Senate. ""The reason I say it\'s a heavy lift is once you change a rule or you have a carve out -- I\'ve always said this -- anytime there\'s a carve out, you eat the whole turkey. There\'s nothing left because it comes back and forth,"" he said.State legislators gear up to pass a \'tidal wave\' of voting restrictions ahead of crucial 2022 midtermsBut House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday poured more pressure on recalcitrant senators from her party, describing Republican state voting laws, which in many cases make it harder to cast ballots and easier for politicians to interfere in elections, as a ""very major threat on our democracy."" ""They are not only suppressing the vote ... they are nullifying elections,"" the California Democrat said on CBS\'s ""Face the Nation.""Republicans like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell accuse Democrats of threatening the right of states to run their own elections. Many of the new state laws, however, are justified on the grounds of ""election integrity"" -- a code word rooted in Trump\'s lies about voter fraud in the 2020 presidential vote that have been disproved multiple times.Russia and China think \'democracy\'s days are numbered\'During his January 6 anniversary speech in Statuary Hall in the Capitol on Thursday, Biden warned that foreign enemies were watching to see whether the United States safeguarded its own democracy under an unprecedented threat in modern times.""From China to Russia and beyond, they\'re betting that democracy\'s days are numbered,"" Biden said. ""They\'re betting America\'s a place for the autocrat, the dictator, the strongman.""Two of the most dangerous US foreign policy challenges involve two democracies -- Taiwan and Ukraine -- pinning their hopes of survival on American support as they exist under threat from much more powerful and proprietorial autocracies, China and Russia.Biden has personally warned Putin at several virtual summits of devastating sanctions if he orders tens of thousands of Russia troops into Ukraine to follow up on the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014. US officials will give the same message this week in talks that began on Sunday with a working dinner between Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov in Geneva. The talks will resume on Monday. Two days later, the NATO-Russia Council will convene in Brussels. The Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which includes both Russia and the United States, meets on Thursday.But there is little hope of progress. The United States argues that Russia is demanding concessions that would permanently weaken NATO in Europe with its calls for the withdrawal of troops and weapons from ex-Warsaw Pact nations. Moscow also wants assurances that Ukraine -- a former Soviet state -- will never be allowed to join the alliance.""It\'s hard to see making actual progress, as opposed to talking, in an atmosphere of escalation with a gun to Ukraine\'s head,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Tapper on ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. Ryabkov was equally downbeat, saying he was ""disappointed"" by signals from Washington and Brussels. ""In short, they reflect a lack of understanding of what we need,"" he said before laying out a wish list the West will never accept. ""We need legal guarantees, legal guarantees that NATO will not expand further, eliminate everything that the alliance has created, driven by anti-Russian phobias and all sorts of false ideas about what is the essence of Russian policy for the period since 1997."" His warning was chillingly resonant of late 20th century clashes between two ideologically opposed superpowers. While talk of a second Cold War now often refers to a building American clash with China rather than Russia, there is one big difference between the period between the end of World War II and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Back then, the challenge to America democracy came mostly from abroad. Now, it is under siege at home.', 'Pro-Trump Republicans try to rewrite state election laws as a voting rights showdown looms in CongressBy Fredreka Schouten, CNNUpdated 11:26 PM ET, Sun January 9, 2022  A voter fills out her ballot on the last day of early voting at the Lansing City Clerk\'s office on November 2, 2020, in Lansing, Michigan. (CNN)In Michigan, a group of Donald Trump\'s supporters is working on a petition to mandate an outside audit of the 2020 election and establish a grand jury with the power to arrest election officials who refuse to cooperate. In Wisconsin, some GOP lawmakers are trying to sideline a bipartisan commission that oversees elections in the state.And Republican legislators from Arizona to Florida are planning to take up new voting restrictions in upcoming legislative sessions.As a likely showdown looms in Congress this week over federal voting legislation, Republicans aligned with the former President are pressing ahead at the state level to change voting procedures, conduct partisan investigations of the last presidential contest and seize more control over the machinery of elections.Democrats and voting rights advocates warn that the unrelenting campaign to cast doubt on the legitimacy of President Joe Biden\'s 2020 victory over Trump could erode voter confidence in elections and increase the chances that losing candidates and their supporters will challenge the results of free and fair elections in the future.Read More""Every day that goes by, I am more and more concerned about the direction and resilience of American democracy,"" said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research. ""I\'m worried that we are heading down a path where there are those who cannot accept that ... their candidate could lose.""Recent polling underscores the peril.  A CBS News-YouGov poll found that more than 6 in 10 of Americans said they now expect violence over the loss of future presidential elections. And a separate poll from The Washington Post and the University of Maryland found that about one in three Americans think violent action against the government is sometimes justified.The Post-UMD poll also exposed a stark partisan divide: 40% of Republicans and 41% of Independents said violence against the government could be justified versus 23% of Democrats.\'Slow-moving insurrection\'In the last year, 19 states passed 34 laws that restrict voting in some way, according to an analysis by the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice. And more changes are expected as state legislatures convene early this year. Brennan\'s analysis found 88 restrictive bills introduced last year will carry over into upcoming legislative sessions, and that 13 new bills had been pre-filed as of last month.  The new proposals include a measure that would ban the use of drop boxes in Georgia -- where Biden became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state in 28 years. An Arizona lawmaker wants to establish stricter voter ID requirements. In Florida, a state Trump won handily, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis is pushing a new package of voting measures that includes increasing penalties for collecting voters\' ballots and establishing a new office to investigate and prosecute election fraud.Meanwhile, in Michigan, where Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer vetoed several GOP-sponsored election bills last year, Republican activists are collecting signatures to attempt an end-run around the governor.The initiative would establish new voter ID requirements, along with barring election officials from sending absentee ballot applications to all voters. The state, which Biden won by about 154,000 votes, saw record turnout in the last presidential election, with some 3.2 million voters casting absentee ballots.Under a quirk in the state constitution, if the Secure MI Vote organizers gather at least 340,047 valid signatures in support of their initiative, the GOP-controlled House and Senate can enact the changes without Whitmer having the power to veto it.Jamie Roe, a spokesman for the group, said volunteers are ""on the path"" to reaching their goal but declined to say how many signatures they have collected.Trump loyalists in Michigan also are seeking state approval to circulate a second petition that would mandate a third-party ""audit"" of the 2020 election. Republican state legislative candidate Jon Rocha, one of the petition\'s backers, told CNN that he believes Trump prevailed in Michigan in 2020 and said there have been ""enough inconsistencies"" to warrant a ""forensic audit"" of results.If successful, the audit initiative would establish a grand jury with power to subpoena evidence and issue arrest warrants for those ""impeding or otherwise stalling"" the audit\'s progress. There has been no evidence of widespread fraud in Michigan. And last June, a committee led by Republican legislators in the state debunked a raft of fraud claims pushed by Trump and his allies. Trump aides did not respond to requests for comment, but the former President has maintained an intense focus on Michigan. Last November, he castigated the state\'s Republican legislative leaders as ""cowards"" and ""spineless"" for refusing to agree to his demands for an audit of the 2020 election.The former President has endorsed Rocha\'s candidacy -- along with a clutch of other statewide and legislative candidates in Michigan who have questioned the legitimacy of the 2020 election.Mark Brewer, a former Michigan Democratic Party chairman who practices election and campaign finance law, said the activity by Trump loyalists feels like ""a slow-moving insurrection that I think is laying the groundwork to undermine elections in 2022 and 2024.""Wisconsin showdownIn Wisconsin, a swing state where the last two presidential elections have been decided by narrow margins, the battles over election administration have grown more heated.A months-long Republican investigation of the 2020 election ordered by the Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos has extended into the new year. Michael Gableman, a former state Supreme Court justice Vos hired to oversee the probe, recently issued a new round of subpoenas, seeking more information from municipal city officials and the Wisconsin Elections Commission, an election agency overseen by a bipartisan board.Ann Jacobs, a Democratic lawyer from Milwaukee who serves as the elections commission\'s chairwoman, said Gableman\'s team recently delivered an ""insanely broad"" subpoena to an IT employee at the agency. It demanded ""any and all communications"" about the 2020 election between the employee and any other person since January 1, 2020, she said.Gableman previously asked a judge to arrest two mayors after failed attempts to compel the officials to testify behind closed doors and provide documents. Court cases related to Gableman\'s subpoenas are pending.Gableman\'s office did not respond to CNN interview requests. Vos spokeswoman Angela Joyce said in an email Friday that the Speaker has asked Gableman for recommendations by February that could help shape new laws this year during the legislative session.A recount and court rulings have affirmed that Biden won Wisconsin by a little more than 20,600 votes out of 3.3 million cast. And independent reviews by the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau and the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty have not found any widespread fraud. The reviews have called for updates to the commission\'s policies and state laws.Republicans have attacked the election agency for months over issuing guidance to local election clerks that eased voting rules during the pandemic. One county sheriff recommended felony charges against five of the commissioners.A new proposal circulating among legislators from GOP state Rep. Timothy Ramthun would dissolve the commission and transfer its duties to the secretary of state. He did not respond to interview requests from CNN.US Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican, has gone further, suggesting that the GOP-controlled state legislature seize oversight of federal elections in the state, bypassing the elections commission. The idea has received a cool reception from state legislative leaders so far.Johnson, however, has not backed down, citing a portion of the US Constitution that gives state legislatures the authority to establish the ""times, places and manner"" of federal elections. ""It\'s time for the state legislature to reclaim its constitutional authority over federal elections and make sure that our election clerks follow the law,"" he said, in part, in a statement to CNN.Jacobs, the commission\'s chairwoman, said the rhetoric about elections in Wisconsin has moved into a ""much more insidious and much more dangerous"" direction than ever before. ""This cannot be what\'s accepted as normal,"" she said.CNN\'s Devan Cole contributed to this story.', 'Is there a version of Biden\'s economic plan that Joe Manchin can support?Analysis by John Harwood, CNNUpdated 5:58 PM ET, Sun January 9, 2022 JUST WATCHEDDead or alive? A look at the status of Biden\'s Build Back Better billReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDead or alive? A look at the status of Biden\'s Build Back Better bill 13:30 (CNN)In 2009, Senate Democrats spent months courting Republican Charles Grassley in search of bipartisan support for the Affordable Care Act. By that September, President Barack Obama had lost patience.""Let me ask you a question, Chuck,"" Obama said in an Oval Office meeting he recounted in his 2020 memoir. ""Are there any changes -- any at all -- that would get us your vote?""""I guess not, Mr. President,"" Grassley replied, concluding negotiations.Is Sen. Joe Manchin now reprising Grassley\'s role on President Joe Biden\'s Build Back Better plan? If so -- if nothing can ultimately get the West Virginia Democrat to ""yes"" -- then more wheedling represents a waste of time. The legislation cannot pass without him.But the White House and party leaders, believing they cannot afford to fail, maintain hope that Manchin\'s vote can be won. That means exploring ways to reshape Biden\'s plan to meet the senator\'s objections.How months of talks between Biden and Manchin over Build Back Better broke down Read MoreIn theory, that shouldn\'t be so hard.Like the President, Manchin agrees an acceptable package could spend $1.75 trillion over 10 years. Before his bombshell pre-Christmas announcement of opposition to the House-passed version of the massive tax and spending bill that would expand the nation\'s social safety net, he had handed Biden a $1.8 trillion version.That\'s roughly half the President\'s original proposal, but other congressional Democrats have made clear they can accept that reduction. The challenge is determining how to spend it.As they whittled the price tag last year, House Democrats decided against culling many programs from Build Back Better. Instead, they financed them for only part of the 10-year span used in budget legislation, figuring a later Congress wouldn\'t let the money run out. Manchin complains that ""gimmick"" obscures the plan\'s true long-term cost. He\'d rather discard some proposals and fully fund those that remain. Sen. Joe Manchin speaks to reporters outside his office on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, January 4, 2022. That would inflict pain on Democratic union and social service constituencies that yearn for more money. Yet $1.75 trillion could still finance major priorities Democrats appear to agree on. Championing his coal-producing state, Manchin slams as unduly punitive some Build Back Better proposals to ameliorate climate change. But he insists he supports most of the bill\'s climate provisions. Overall, they cost $550 billion.Manchin also backs new subsidies to help parents obtain child care and prekindergarten education for 3- and 4-year-olds. Permanent funding for those parts of Build Back Better, the Congressional Budget Office estimates, takes $752 billion. Nor has Manchin objected to more financial help for Americans seeking health insurance under the Affordable Care Act (which Congress finally enacted in March 2010 without Grassley\'s support). Permanent funding for those Build Back Better provisions, CBO says, would cost $428 billion.A bill with those elements -- on climate change, child care, prekindergarten and Obamacare -- would represent a major advance for Democratic priorities. And the cumulative $1.73 trillion cost would fit Manchin\'s compromise budget.\'I\'m kind of speechless\': Democrats scramble to salvage climate provisions after Manchin sinks Build Back BetterOf course, that list omits hundreds of billions\' worth of other Biden proposals, including money to expand the housing supply, raise home health care workers\' pay, add hearing benefits under Medicare and augment the Earned Income Tax Credit for childless adults.More politically precarious, it also omits the Build Back Better provision many Democrats value most: an expanded Child Tax Credit that analysts say reduces childhood poverty by 40%. Manchin says too much of the money -- more than $1 trillion over 10 years if funded permanently -- would be squandered by undeserving recipients.Yet just a tiny fraction of that investment would deliver much of the benefit Democrats seek.For $50 billion over 10 years, the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities projects, Congress could cut child poverty 20% without even increasing the maximum Child Tax Credit that this administration inherited from President Donald Trump. The reduction would come from making the pre-Biden credit ""fully refundable"" -- available even to parents who don\'t earn enough to generate federal income tax liabilities.That\'s something Manchin does oppose, insisting it gives some parents without jobs money to spend on drugs rather than their children. But if fellow Democrats could persuade him to compromise, adding Child Tax Credit refundability would partially address their priority while leaving the cost of a revised Biden plan below $1.8 trillion.10 things you didn\'t know are in the Democrats\' Build Back Better billManchin also fears Build Back Better spending would expand the budget deficit and exacerbate inflation. But deficit hawks at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget say Biden has specified more than $2 trillion in bona fide financing sources, while economists in both parties envision the bill having a negligible inflationary impact.In other words, a hypothetical package along these lines would seem to meet Manchin\'s concerns. The question is whether his stated objections can be taken at face value.In the 2020 election, Trump defeated Biden in West Virginia by 39 percentage points -- a larger margin than anywhere except Wyoming. With a coal-loving constituency like that, perhaps Manchin -- like Grassley on Obama\'s health care plan -- simply cannot bring himself to push Biden\'s economic and climate agenda over the finish line.That did not, however, stop him from joining the party-line vote to pass Biden\'s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan last March. The next few weeks will tell whether the White House and Democratic leaders can make it happen again.', 'Biden has lowest first-year Senate confirmation rate among last three presidents, according to new report By Devan Cole, CNNUpdated 1:26 PM ET, Sun January 9, 2022 Washington (CNN)President Joe Biden has the lowest Senate confirmation rate of first-year nominations among the last three presidents, according to a new report from a group that studies presidential transitions. ""In Biden\'s first year, the Senate confirmed only 41% of his nominations. While a small number were withdrawn by the president, 118 were \'returned\' at the end of the Senate\'s session -- meaning the president would either have to nominate that person again in the next session or nominate someone else,"" according to the report from the Center for Presidential Transition, a nonpartisan group based in Washington, DC. The group, which said its data represents ""nominations for all civilian positions including ambassadors, judges, marshals and US attorneys,"" reported that as of last week, 171 of the nominations Biden made in 2021 are still awaiting a vote.

', 'Fears of extremist violence go \'well beyond\' January 6 anniversaryBy Geneva Sands, CNNUpdated 11:02 AM ET, Sun January 9, 2022 Police stand outside the Belmar shopping center where they say the suspect in a shooting spree that claimed five lives was shot and killed on December 27, 2021 in Lakewood, Colorado. (CNN)A year after the attack on the US Capitol, homeland security and law enforcement officials nationwide are bracing for potential ""unprecedented"" levels of violence this year as midterm elections kick into gear and the pandemic continues to affect everyday life.The country remains polarized, and many people are angry and frustrated about their individual selves or society\'s conditions after two years of Covid-19 upheaval, turbulent economic conditions and government restrictions, sources and non-governmental researchers told CNN.Late last month in a string of unrelated incidents, a gunman killed five people in the Denver area, a man was stopped on his way to Washington, DC with weapons and a ""hit list,"" and a New Year\'s Eve fire at Planned Parenthood facility in Tennessee was declared arson. All these incidents come as officials are already preparing for protests in the nation\'s capital later this month. Societal divisions coupled with online and media content that is saturated with conspiracy theories and disinformation has led officials to worry that the levels of violence in 2022 could be ""unprecedented,"" a federal law enforcement official said. While much attention focused on the January 6 anniversary, ""from a law enforcement perspective, it goes well beyond that,"" the official said. Another concern is that the volatility will only increase as the election cycle progresses and we get closer to the 2022 midterm elections, they added. Read MoreFractures in US society and the spread of misinformation are likely to be exacerbated during the election cycle, the official said, pointing out that public figures, such as those running for office, those who hold elected office and those in the media who comment about these issues will only increase their activities. ""It\'s not a pleasant forecast,"" said Peter Simi, an associate professor at Chapman University who studies extremist groups and violence. ""I think we see the threats mounting. And really transitioning into what we might call \'an everyday insurgency.\'"" One year after the January 6 Capitol riot, far-right extremists still contend the 2020 election was stolen, according to recent report from SITE Intelligence Group, a non-governmental organization that tracks online extremist activity. However, these extremist groups have dispersed their focus on various issues, like vaccines, Covid-19 conspiracy theories and Biden administration policies, the report found.  ""To be clear, however, the extremist momentum behind January 6 has not diminished -- it has spread in all directions,"" SITE director Rita Katz said. That energy has been redirected toward Covid-19 mitigation measures, the migrant crisis at the Southern border, critical race theory and elections, she added. She also pointed to the upcoming Congressional elections, ""which will be centered on the same hot-button topics these violent extremist actors have pivoted towards."" Conspiratorial election and voting fraud theories are a major concernIdeologies of hate, false information, false narratives are primary sources of the threat landscape in the US today, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told CNN Wednesday.  ""The divisiveness in our country is really fueling it as well,"" he said. ""Words matter. And the words of leaders matter a lot. And that can actually fuel the spread of false information and can drive people to violence.""  Conspiracy theories about election fraud, which probably contributed to the breach of the US Capitol last year, continue to resonate among domestic violent extremists, according to a recent DHS intelligence assessment obtained by CNN.  Mayorkas told reporters this week that the department is ""very, very focused on the security and integrity of our election processes,"" when asked if he was worried about threats connected to the upcoming midterm election cycle.Over the past year, there has been a dramatic uptick of threats made against lawmakers, with 9,600 in 2021 alone, US Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger said this week. A senior Capitol security official previously attributed that increase in part to ""a more bitter and partisan political environment and citizens for whom the issues that they\'re angry about are core value and identity issues."" As always, the problem remains sifting through the noise of angry tweeters versus actual threats, the security official said, adding that the ""majority"" of threats don\'t ""represent a risk of real violence."" DHS intelligence chief John Cohen told KNX News radio on Wednesday, ""What keeps me up at night, and I know is keeping up a number of my colleagues around the country, is not just the anniversary of January 6, but the threat environment as we enter 2022.""Cohen pointed to the polarization of US society, as well as efforts from foreign intelligence services, terrorist organizations and domestic extremist thought leaders who seek to exacerbate social tensions, undermine credibility in the US government and inspire violence by planting and spreading online and media content.  There continues to be a ""steady tempo of mass casualty attacks by angry, disaffected people who are inspired by the content that they\'re consuming online,"" he said during the interview. Mass casualty incidents, for example, in Denver, Atlanta, Indianapolis over the past year all displayed signs of the volatile threats concerning law enforcement today, with some suspects coming to the attention of law enforcement before they carried out attacks. Last month, a California man was stopped by the Cass County Sheriff\'s department in Iowa with a ""hit list"" of people he intended to kill, including Anthony Fauci and Mark Zuckerberg, according to a federal criminal complaint. He had the address of the White House in his GPS and told investigators he would kill President Joe Biden, the complaint said. The suspect\'s attorney told the court he intends to rely upon an insanity defense. What\'s law enforcement doing about it?Mayorkas said that DHS has increased and improved information sharing with local communities over the past year to help counter the threat from domestic terrorism, as well as added local grant funding and established a new, dedicated domestic terrorism branch. Many in law enforcement have been working to ramp up information sharing over the past year. For example, law enforcement officials nationwide were recently able to see there were around 200 threats to schools across the country that had proliferated on TikTok, a law enforcement source said. Vague and viral TikTok warning of school violence is not credible but has schools and law enforcement on high alert""Previously, we had no capability to see all those threats at the same time, where they were and what type of threats there were,"" the source said, pointing to the failures leading up the January 6, 2021. That said, there is still on the federal government side, a ""large disconnect between the many portals that the government manages,"" the source said. DHS, FBI and local authorities all manage different systems that are difficult to coordinate, the source added.  Last month, Cohen raised concerns about the ability for law enforcement to manage threats across the US. ""We do not yet have, across the United States, a consistent level of capability that is designed to enable threat assessment and threat management activities at the local level,"" Cohen said during a George Washington University forum. Mayorkas agreed last week, saying, ""We are in fact, seeing an uneven level of capabilities in local communities.""Neither official mentioned specific communities, but the secretary said the unevenness underscores the importance of information sharing and intelligence sharing among law enforcement and homeland security officials. The suspect in the recent metro Denver shooting spree, for instance, was investigated by Denver police in 2020 and early 2021 but charges were never filed. The gunman -- identified as Lyndon James McLeod, 47, foreshadowed the rampage in a series of books he wrote under a pseudonym, and he used the names of actual victims in his writings, CNN reported. ""This individual was on the radar of law enforcement,"" Denver Police Chief Paul Pazen previously said without elaborating. Five people were killed in the shootings and several were wounded, including a policewoman.Without providing specifics, Mayorkas said that in the last several weeks, DHS has seen the benefits of information sharing, in a situation ""where a particular community was not necessarily as developed in its apparatus, or evolved as others, but nevertheless, through the information we imparted to it, it was able to identify a potential threat before that threat materialized and inform us.""\'Asleep at the wheel\'A year after the January 6 Capitol riot, the extremism landscape is ""all over the map,"" Seamus Hughes, deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, told CNN.  There are traditional White supremacists, anti-government groups and accelerationists, as well as a ""significant group of folks"" that are interested in ISIS and Al Qaeda, he said. The objective of accelerationism is to foment divisiveness and polarization that will induce the collapse of the existing order and spark a civil war, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, which recently wrote about the perils of the movement. The lack of large-scale events similar to the January 6 riot over the past year, is a reflection of a fracturing movement combined with the efforts of law enforcement, according to Hughes.  Looking ahead to the election season, Hughes pointed out that while there has been a rise in threats against election officials and public officials, several elections have safely taken place since last January.   When it comes to far-right extremism, Simi, the Chapman University professor, told CNN, ""We\'ve been asleep at the wheel for a long time,"" in part making it difficult for the public to understand the multiple threats facing the US. ""Part of that is because it\'s an insider threat. It\'s easier to point to something from the outside, those that are attacking us from outside,"" he said, referencing the terrorism of 9/11.

Ron Johnson says he will run for reelectionBy Daniella Diaz and Chandelis Duster, CNNUpdated 10:33 AM ET, Sun January 9, 2022 Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, Wisconsin Republican, speaks during a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing to discuss election security and the 2020 election process on December 16, 2020 in Washington, DC.  (CNN)Sen. Ron Johnson announced in an email on Sunday that he is running for reelection in Wisconsin, setting the stage for a tough campaign in a race that could determine control of the Senate.Johnson, a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, said in the email, ""I am announcing I will continue to fight for freedom in the public realm by running for re-election. It is not a decision I have made lightly.""Johnson\'s announcement comes one day after Senate Minority Whip John Thune said he would seek reelection for his South Dakota seat. Johnson is the last incumbent Republican to announce his decision to seek reelection in this year\'s midterms.GOP banking on Ron Johnson run in crucial Senate race Democrats have attacked Johnson for misleading the public on the Covid-19 vaccine, downplaying the January 6 attack and dismissing climate change.Johnson has questioned the safety of Covid-19 vaccines while his office maintains that he supports use of the vaccine. He has touted the benefits of alternative drugs like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin that federal health officials say have not been proven effective in treating Covid-19.Read MoreAnd after the Republican-led Senate acquitted Trump in the 2020 impeachment trial, Johnson used his position as chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee to investigate then-presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter\'s foreign financial dealings in Ukraine. The panel did not conclude that Biden altered US policy to benefit his son.Johnson has also continued to try to shift blame away from Trump for the violence of January 6, 2021, suggesting that a small group of provocateurs may have been responsible for turning a largely peaceful protest of the 2020 election into a rampage that left five dead and about 140 police officers injured.Sen. Ron Johnson\'s evolution from Tea Party insurgent to conspiracy theory promoterIn an op-ed published Sunday in the Wall Street Journal, Johnson writes that although he\'d like to retire, he is running for reelection because he believes America ""is in peril."" ""Instead of everyone working to achieve the goal President Biden stated during his inaugural address—unifying and healing America—it feels as if our nation is being torn apart,"" the Republican senator wrote criticizing policies by Democrats that he believes have failed Americans.Wisconsin Lt.

Biden narrowly won five of those states in 2020 and narrowly lost the sixth, North Carolina, but a backlash against his presidency and the history of midterms working against the incumbent has left Republicans optimistic that they will take back the Senate in 2022.Democrats currently control the 50-50 Senate with the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Kamala Harris.This story has been updated.CNN\'s Manu Raju contributed to this report.', 'JUST WATCHEDA look at the life of Oscar winner Sidney PoitierReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHA look at the life of Oscar winner Sidney Poitier 03:47Start your week smart: Pakistan, Space telescope, Sidney Poitier, Arbery, OmicronBy AJ Willingham, CNNUpdated 10:33 AM ET, Sun January 9, 2022The demand for Covid-19 tests is so high and supplies are so low that some desperate people are going online to buy them.

We\'re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. (CNN)In Christian tradition, January 6 is the feast of the Epiphany, which marks both an ending and beginning. It\'s the twelfth day after Christmas, and, if you observe, celebrates the revelation of divinity shown to the three Magi when they visit the human baby Jesus.  The word ""epiphany"" -- which the Oxford English Dictionary defines as a ""manifestation"" or ""striking appearance, especially an appearance of a divinity"" -- also connotes more secular forms of incarnation. A sudden idea or unexpected perception, a breakthrough, an upending of the ordinary. Poet Mary Oliver, whose work some theologians cite in connection with moments of spiritual revelation, writes in an oft-quoted passage from her poem ""Sometimes"":  Instructions for living a life:Pay attention. Be astonished.Tell about it.Read More This year, as it was in 2021, January 6 was something more than Epiphany, and will forever be marked as a wound in America\'s collective memory, but it\'s still worth asking what was being made manifest in the United States on this day a year ago, and what\'s appearing to us now. ""I woke up knowing it was going to be a difficult day, but I had no idea that it would take the harrowing turn that it did,"" recalled Rep. Colin Allred, who described texting his wife, ""Whatever happens, I love you"" as a ""violent mob of Trump supporters was descending on the US Capitol."" When members of Congress returned that evening to finalize the election result, said Allred, ""Democracy held, but it showed dangerous signs of fracturing."" Farai Chideya, who was covering the ""Stop the Steal"" rally in downtown Washington, DC and reflected on what she\'s learned in the year since, wrote in terms redolent of Oliver\'s ""instructions for living a life"" when she observed parallels between the day\'s violence and the unrest depicted in protests over busing in the year of America\'s bicentennial: ""really, it was over democracy: who is part of it; who is excluded; and who gets to tell its story."" Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion\'s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook Chideya, who has been reporting about extremism for many years, proposed steps journalism and civil society alike can take to avoid ""watching democracy burn"" -- stop treating extremists like an other, and most of all, ""be prepared to live in psychic discomfort over the state of American democracy, and do so indefinitely. Just as we are learning to adapt to the pandemic, to the fatiguing array of choices we face under pain of death or illness, we can learn to adapt to an America where we have to face threats to democracy head-on.""  Those threats are chillingly real and continue to grow, argued Peter Bergen, because while the insurrection at the US Capitol was a peak of contemporary White nationalism in America, it was also ""a dress rehearsal for what will likely come next.""  Bergen connected the dots between a White nationalist past defined by racists like William Luther Pierce and Louis Beam and a present reflected in polls showing over three quarters of Republicans falsely believe Biden did not win the 2020 presidential election and one in three Americans ""endorses the view that violence against the government is sometimes justified.""   Peniel E. Joseph outlined how two opposing historical forces -- reconstructionism and redemptionism -- have defined American historical memory since the post-Civil War moment and still have the power to shape US democracy in 2022: ""these competing worldviews continue, for better and worse, to forge our national identity. But they do not predetermine our destiny unless we let them.""  Where do we go from here?  President Joe Biden\'s speech on the anniversary of January 6 signaled a stark shift in his approach to the nation\'s ongoing crisis of democracy, Frida Ghitis wrote. Jabbing at former President Donald Trump for his role in setting the stage for the insurrection -- mentioning him 16 times without uttering his name -- Biden\'s ""words and delivery were quite a contrast from the Biden whose speeches, especially those dealing with democracy and the future of the nation, have tended to emphasize national unity and reconciliation. The shift reflected a recognition that the insurrection of January 6 is not simply a part of the past, but a looming threat into the future.""   Former President Jimmy Carter warned in the New York Times: ""Our great nation now teeters on the brink of a widening abyss. Without immediate action, we are at genuine risk of civil conflict and losing our precious democracy."" But where must America go from here?  In the Wall Street Journal, Karl Rove urged his fellow Republicans to hold themselves accountable for the events of January 6 and asked them to answer the question: What would you have done if Democrats did this?  The perils confronting American democracy now are the result of deeper forces, noted Laura Coates. Accountability for the events of January 6 goes hand in hand with a push for voting rights, Coates wrote: ""It would be foolish to investigate an insurrection without continuing parallel investigations by the Department of Justice into state laws that target minority voters by adopting laws with discriminatory features, that actively seek to disenfranchise them, and gerrymandered districts that dilute their voting power and strength."" She emphasized the ""Big Lie"" that Trump was denied a victory through election fraud ""remains false, but the self-evident truth is that our democracy is under attack by those who keenly understand the power of the vote. It is not widespread voter fraud that they fear; it is widespread voter participation.""  The political polarization of the last year and Congress\'s failures to implement reforms to protect democracy have made it all the more ""urgent for Americans outside of government to redouble their efforts to safeguard democratic governance and the values that underwrite it,"" cautioned Nicole Hemmer. She laid out four things ordinary Americans can do to support and protect democracy: Tell the truth about January 6, talk about values instead of norms, engage in local activism and invest in reviving civic life and institutions.  More sharp commentary:  John Avlon: ""How to stop a second insurrection""   Christine Todd Whitman, Norman Eisen and Joanna Lydgate: ""What the January 6 report means for the future of democracy"" Supreme Court\'s majority flexes its musclesAfter oral arguments Friday over federal Covid-19 vaccine mandates, Jeffrey Toobin observed the Supreme Court\'s conservative majority appeared ready to rule against the Biden administration. ""Several justices went out of their way to say they were not against vaccines, but they were against government mandates,"" Toobin pointed out. ""Whatever the reasons that ultimately justify the rulings, the most likely outcome for the country seemed clear: fewer required vaccinations and testing, likely leading to greater sickness and even more death.""  The arguments and their outcome could also foreshadow the conservative majority\'s broader view of executive power, analyzed Jennifer Rodgers -- ""the ruling may provide a window into the court\'s thinking that may be instructive to lower courts and serve as a precursor of what will happen when the court is faced with the same or similar issue in the future.""  \'The kids are not ok\'Anushay Hossain and LaylaWhen her daughter -- too young to be vaccinated -- contracted Covid-19 after an outbreak in her pre-kindergarten classroom, Anushay Hossain and her husband ""spent a few sleepless nights fighting to bring her 103-degree fever down as our little warrior coughed and struggled with congestion."" Thankfully, she recovered, but ""the experience was still traumatic,"" stressed Hossain, who ""can\'t stop thinking about how, as a country, the US just can\'t seem to effectively prioritize the well-being of children"" when it comes to Covid policies or access to necessary resources like mental health support or affordable child care. ""The kids are not OK,"" she insisted. Neither are the parents, argued SE Cupp -- the confused Covid-19 messaging is exhausting, as is grappling with the difficult decision to send kids to school or not. Parents are flooded with anxiety, stoked by rapid Omicron spread, fuzzy guidance and bad actors in politics and at some right-wing media outlets who are exploiting the trauma. She concluded: ""It\'s okay to demand better of our public health officials without calling into question their motives or the whole of science. We\'ll get through this if we can drown out the noise, ignore the nonsense and focus on the things we know have worked.""  Of the contentious question of schools, Dr. Leana Wen wrote for the Washington Post: ""It\'s wrong for politicians to stop the use of readily available mitigation measures such as masks. But it\'s equally wrong to argue that unless every protection is in place, schools cannot remain open.""  More perspectives:  Dr. Richard Besser: ""Why it\'s impossible for some people to follow Covid-19 guidelines"" Jill Filipovic: ""2022: Like 2020, but with more disasters""   What the Novak Djokovic saga revealed  On Tuesday, tennis star Novak Djokovic (who has not volunteered his vaccination status and has spoken out against the Covid-19 vaccine) announced tournament officials had granted him a medical exemption to play at the Australian Open, touching off a firestorm of international controversy.  After traveling to Australia on a visa which, according to Prime Minister Scott Morrison, does not permit medical exemptions for the unvaccinated, Djokovic remained at the airport and, as Stephanie Myles wrote, ""is now a man in limbo, staying in a hotel used as an immigration detention center, and which has since become a magnet for protesters of all stripes -- from Djokovic supports to refugee advocates.""  The hearing concerning his appeal of the visa cancellation has been adjourned until Monday, said Myles, so Djokovic remains a man in limbo for now, and a man who\'s ""never been particularly good at reading the room"" for a good while longer than that. ""In the end, Djokovic\'s hubris hasn\'t helped. But no one"" -- not the various levels of government, not tennis leadership -- ""comes out of this looking good,"" observed Myles, especially to an Australian fan base which has suffered through some of the harshest lockdowns in the world and has a culturally ingrained sense of fair play. Documents published on Saturday by Australia\'s Federal Circuit Court showed Djokovic was granted a medical exemption to compete after recently recovering from Covid-19.  Elizabeth Holmes\' conviction  After months of testimony and seven days of deliberations, a jury found Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes guilty on four charges of defrauding investors and acquitted her of four other charges. The jury failed to reach a verdict of three additional charges. Overall, this result is still a ""stark rebuke of the defense, which attempted to portray Holmes as a visionary leader who fell victim to subordinates who misled her and investors who misunderstood her"" wrote Jessica A. Roth for CNN Business Perspectives.  The verdict also constituted a ""welcome rejection of the dubious gender stereotypes"" the defense ""rolled out in an effort to secure her acquittal,"" opined Lara Stemple for Slate. ""By arguing that Holmes, whose company was once worth billions, was merely a victim working under the direction of her male business partner, the defense advanced a perspective that risked undermining the fragile gains women have made in tech and business,"" Stemple wrote. What would Betty White do? ""With a life that spanned nearly a century — including more than seven decades in the TV business — it\'s impossible to adequately represent Betty White\'s legacy in a single tribute. And since her death at the age of 99 on December 31 many remembrances have focused on her iconic work as an actor and her award-winning performances,"" Elizabeth Yuko wrote. ""But the perpetually sweet (occasionally foul-mouthed) grande dame of television had a massive and often overlooked influence on American culture off-camera as well.""  In addition to her life as ""TV\'s original trailblazing feminist"" (co-founding a production company in 1952 and becoming the first woman to produce a national television show), White was a vocal supporter and advocate for civil and human rights for decades and was outspoken (in interviews as early as the 1950s) in her efforts to ""normalize and destigmatize the idea that a woman didn\'t have to meet a man, get pregnant and raise a family in order to be considered successful.... Intentional or accidental, White\'s progressive approach has left a visible impact on both the entertainment industry and American culture at large.""   Don\'t miss Sara Stewart: ""\'Yellowjackets\' takes our \'90s nostalgia and gives it fangs""  Julian Zelizer: ""What the Carlson-Cruz exchange reveals about today\'s GOP""  Geoff Duncan: ""The future of the GOP is at stake in this Georgia battle""  David A. Andelman: ""This woman could topple the French President""  Kara Alaimo: ""Twitter just showed how easily we can stop misinformation"" Mark Wolfe for CNN Business Perspectives: ""We can\'t afford to let Build Back Better fail""  Sidney Poitier was aware of the tightrope history asked him to walk  Legendary actor and pioneer Sidney Poitier, who died Friday at 94, ""lived long enough not only to reap full and power acclaim for his groundbreaking body of work,"" marveled Gene Seymour, ""but also to witness wave after wave of Black actors, actresses, writers, directors and craftspeople following the path he helped clear for them.""  As far as Black male film stars go, Seymour noted, ""Without Sir Sidney Poitier, there is no Billy Dee Williams, Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, Eddie Murphy, Forest Whitaker, Michael B. Jordan or, for that matter, that other Michael Jordan, whose ability to parlay his fearsome basketball skills into a cross-cultural, multimedia hyphenate was at least partly enabled by Poitier, who made it safe for Black culture heroes in all kinds of endeavors to connect with Whites as well as other Blacks.""  After his last film in 2001, Poitier received another Oscar for lifetime achievement, and, as Seymour pointed out, ""He had reached the kind of iconic stature once reserved solely for such male icons as John Wayne, James Cagney and Cary Grant. That same night, Poitier got to watch both Denzel Washington and Halle Berry receive lead acting Academy Awards, with Berry being the first Black actress to receive the award. You can\'t say for certain, but you have to believe that Poitier believed those latter two events represented a greater, more significant recognition of his long quest for acceptance and achievement than another gold statuette.""']","['Archbishop Desmond Tutu attends an event in Cape Town, South Africa, in April 2019.Rodger Bosch/AFP/Getty ImagesDesmond Tutu: A life in picturesUpdated 11:12 AM ET, Fri December 31, 2021Archbishop Desmond Tutu attends an event in Cape Town, South Africa, in April 2019.Rodger Bosch/AFP/Getty ImagesDesmond Tutu, the first Black archbishop of Cape Town, South Africa, and who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his efforts to end apartheid, has died at the age of 90.In a statement confirming his death on Sunday, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa expressed his condolences to Tutu\'s family and friends, calling him ""a patriot without equal.""Tutu played a key role in South Africa\'s transition from the apartheid era, including serving as chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission at the direction of then-President Nelson Mandela.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN)In the spring of 2006, I received an unexpected call from my friend and client, Barack Obama, who was then a little more than a year into his career in the US Senate.""I just had the strangest conversation with Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer,"" he told me, fresh from a meeting with the US Senate Democratic leaders. ""I didn\'t know why they were calling me over there. Turns out they wanted to tell me I should run for president.""Harry Reid, a longtime US senator from Nevada and former Democratic leader, dies at 82  Reid, then Senate minority leader, argued that, unlike the presumptive frontrunner -- Hillary Clinton -- Obama was untainted by a vote for the unpopular war in Iraq, an albatross the leader feared would sink her and take some of his party\'s Senate candidates down in the undertow. Far from viewing Obama\'s newness to Washington, DC, as an impediment, Reid, who had served there for over 20 years, argued that the young senator\'s freshness would be an asset to a country hungry for change.""They pushed me pretty hard to think about it,"" Obama told me, still absorbing the full meaning of what had just transpired. ""I still think it\'s pretty far-fetched, but it\'s interesting that they felt as strongly as they do."" I can\'t say that Obama would never have come around to the idea of running for president without the quiet encouragement of Reid that spring. But I can say for sure that their conversation made a deep impression on the young senator, who knew that Reid hadn\'t fought his way up through the rough-and-tumble of Nevada politics and the ranks of the US Senate by making careless bets.Read MoreThe fact that the leader would buck the party establishment, of which he was part, by planting the seeds of an insurgency was an unexpected turn that begged serious consideration.As different as they seemed, a tremendous bond grew between the understated Reid -- who died Tuesday at 82 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer -- and the charismatic young president he helped propel forward. Reid\'s improbable rise from hardscrabble beginnings in the tiny brothel town of Searchlight, Nevada, was the stuff of legends, and he saw in Obama someone who had overcome his own hardships -- along with withering racial barriers -- to achieve unimaginable heights.JUST WATCHEDGergen looks back on Harry Reid\'s career in the SenateReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHGergen looks back on Harry Reid\'s career in the Senate 02:29After the election of 2008, Reid, by then Senate majority leader, sat down with President-elect Obama. A prizefighter in his youth, Reid made a point by recalling his days in the ring. ""I wasn\'t the fastest guy. I wasn\'t the strongest. But I sure could take a punch!""And he would take, and throw, many punches for Obama\'s agenda. Along with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Reid\'s persistence helped deliver the Affordable Care Act after an epic battle, an achievement which he said had particular meaning to him because of the privations he had seen uninsured family members and neighbors suffer in his life.""I felt a tremendous pressure to get it done. And having been raised the way that I was with no health care, my mother had no teeth, we didn\'t go to doctors... it was one of the landmark pieces of legislation in the history of this country,"" he told me in 2019. But if Reid, who served as the Democratic leader for 12 years, was a point man for his president, he also was a hard-nosed realist when it came to protecting the members of his caucus from unnecessarily risky votes.He called me in the early summer of 2009 and wanted to talk about a cap-and-trade bill we had passed through the US House of Representatives to reduce the carbon emissions that were accelerating climate change. The bill was controversial in energy-producing states, and the House vote had been a heavy lift. Now we were hoping for a vote in the Senate, which we knew would be even more challenging.""You know we have a lot going on up here this summer, what with the health care bill and a lot of other things we absolutely have to get done,"" Reid said. ""So we\'re not going to get to the climate bill."" He paused. ""Would you tell the President?"" At that moment, the line went dead, which is how every telephone conversation with the leader ended.JUST WATCHEDHarry Reid: I do not regret changing the Senate rulesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHarry Reid: I do not regret changing the Senate rules 03:44""I\'m not much for small talk. The conversation was over; we\'d done our business. There\'s no need to talk anymore,"" he explained to me in 2019 when I asked him about this and his legendary habit of ending calls without saying goodbye.Throughout those years, Reid tangled regularly with Mitch McConnell, who as the Senate Republican leader, led an implacable opposition to Obama, including the brazen decision to block the Senate for the better part of the President\'s final year from taking up the nomination of Merrick Garland to the US Supreme Court.When I last sat down with Reid for ""The Axe Files,"" Reid had plenty to say about that blockade, yet he refrained from making it personal. A proud and pugnacious partisan, he also was a man of the institution. At the end of his life, he was not going to impugn his longtime adversary.  ""I know Mitch McConnell very well, and I\'m not going to disparage him here today,"" he said. ""But I have been somewhat disappointed. I think what he did with the Supreme Court is something that will go down in history as a very dark time in the history of this country.""Reid was a rare person in today\'s politics. A plainspoken man, allergic to flowery rhetoric and performative politics; relentless -- even ruthless -- in pursuit of legislative and electoral victories but animated by time-honored verities and ideals to which he held fast until the end.  And he was palpably proud of his partnership with the 44th president.Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion\'s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookOn the last lap of Obama\'s final campaign in 2012, we made a stop for a rally in Las Vegas.  Reid had requested a minute with Obama to ask him to cut an ad for Mazie Hirono, the Democratic Senate candidate in Hawaii. But after he made the ask, the leader suddenly reached out and hugged the President, a physical display of fellowship and affection that surprised us. Then he turned abruptly and, like a Reid phone call, he was gone without another word.In 2019, I asked him about that moment and his relationship with the President for whom he had made such a difference.""Well, I don\'t hesitate to say on this show, I don\'t care who\'s listening and this is something I don\'t throw around very often, but I love Barack Obama, I really do,"" he told me. ""No one else could do what he did.""Right back at you, Sen. Reid. May you rest in peace. And may your remarkable memory always be a blessing.', 'Former US Sen.

But his hopes of a 2022 rebound are complicated by equally treacherous tests abroad.The United States faces at least two potential national security crises that could explode in short order. First, it must try to head off a potential invasion of Ukraine by Russia in what would be Moscow\'s boldest bid yet to reshape the post-Cold War order. And unless talks bear fruit soon, Iran could reach the threshold of being a nuclear weapons power, and leave Biden with an excruciating choice of whether to respond with military action that could draw the US back into a Middle East conflagration.As grave as each situation is, both in some ways are a distraction from the epochal 21st-century US foreign policy conundrum: how to handle an increasingly powerful and aggressive China. The intense diplomatic and military attention Washington would need to devote to a showdown with Iran or Russia would delight Beijing, after its rise to prominence coincided with the US quagmires in Iraq and Afghanistan.Of course, a restive world could present Biden with unexpected problems. For instance, no president, possibly since Bill Clinton in the 1990s, has thwarted North Korea\'s nuclear march. And the Stalinist state, marking 10 years under volatile dictator Kim Jong Un, is forging ahead with missiles that could deliver its nuclear bombs to US soil. The Middle East is stuck in the crosshairs of a worsening US-China rivalry But Pyongyang is not alone in defying the US. Biden\'s political fortunes back home have been partly tarnished by rising gasoline prices following his failure to coax major oil producers in the Gulf to pump more crude. The pandemic, meanwhile, threatens to cause more upheaval overseas that could impact US national security. And the Omicron surge could again jam up global supply chains -- ramping up the inflation that threatens Biden\'s Democrats in midterm elections next year.Read MoreIt\'s not all been bad news for the President, a former Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman who boasted on the campaign trail of his statesmanship chops. There has been some diplomatic deftness in his first year in office. Declaring ""America is back,"" Biden soothed allies bruised by former President Donald Trump\'s tantrums and insults. He\'s convinced Western governments to draw up a daunting package of punishments for Russia to deter it from breaching Ukraine\'s borders -- and is offering security talks to Moscow in a long-shot bid to ease tensions. Early last year, he appeared to talk Russian President Vladimir Putin down after a previous Ukraine buildup. And while Trump reset America\'s course in adopting a confrontational posture toward China, Biden has done better in getting US allies in Europe and the Pacific to back US strategy. But his diplomacy has yet to change President Xi Jinping\'s nationalistic, expansionist path, after crushing Hong Kong\'s remaining democracy and as fears grow that he might eventually try to reunify Taiwan with the mainland by force -- a move that could suck the United States into a disastrous war with its Asian rival.Immediate tests as the new year dawnsBiden\'s foreign policy credibility will come in for early scrutiny in 2022.The most intensive diplomatic offensive of his administration so far is seeking to convince Putin to stand down tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine. The integrity of NATO and the health of his own political position depend on Biden defusing the crisis without caving to security guarantees demanded by the Russian leader. Putin, for instance, wants NATO to pull forces from ex-Warsaw Pact nations that joined the alliance -- a condition that could destroy Western credibility and incentivize further Russian adventurism. \'A four-week window\': Biden aims to learn from Obama\'s mistakes with quick moves to deter Putin from invading UkraineIn the latest development, the White House said Tuesday that US and Russian officials would meet on January 10. US, Russian and NATO officials will also be in touch over the following few days. Russia has been agitating for another in-person Biden-Putin summit, a piece of diplomatic choreography that would evoke old Cold War sit-downs. But Biden must walk a fine line -- as he could be accused of appeasing Putin should he eventually move on Ukraine -- while finding an off-ramp for the Russian leader that allows him to save face. The showdown has profound political implications for both Biden and Putin. And the Russian leader, who sees a historic task of reestablishing Russian power at the expense of the US, is a wily adversary who has outmaneuvered the last three US presidents.As their European counterparts try to prevent a war on the continent, America\'s nuclear negotiators are striving to revive the 2015 nuclear deal involving the US and Iran, which was fractured by Trump\'s walkout.Despite some optimism expressed by Russian negotiators at the latest session of talks in Vienna underway since Monday, the US has been deeply skeptical that the diplomatic track will deliver. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Tuesday that it was ""too soon to tell"" whether Iran\'s new hardline government has returned to the table interested in negotiating. And any progress still fell short of ""Iran\'s accelerating nuclear steps,"" Price added.New talks -- at which the US and Iran don\'t meet directly -- are unfolding after top US negotiator Robert Malley issued a dire warning days before Christmas. He told CNN\'s Becky Anderson that Tehran\'s increasing uranium enrichment meant that time was running short for a deal.""If they continue at their current pace, we have some weeks left but not much more than that, at which point, I think, the conclusion will be that there\'s no deal to be revived,"" said Malley, the US Iran envoy. US officials believe Iran is now within months of acquiring the materials for a nuclear bomb. Some Israelis are talking of weeks.Iran is demanding that the US lift all sanctions before it will roll back enrichment. The US is offering a sequenced approach. Its position is complicated by the Biden administration\'s inability to pledge that a future Republican administration would honor any deal. Iran has said it is now enriching uranium up to 60% purity, its highest-ever level and much closer to the 90% threshold needed to build a nuclear bomb. Its progress exposes the utter failure of Trump\'s ""maximum pressure"" policy, introduced when Iran was complying with the Obama administration pact to cap its nuclear program.If diplomacy fails now, Biden -- or ,more immediately, Israel -- will face the question of whether to launch a military strike against Tehran\'s facilities that could set the Middle East aflame once again.Biden\'s fate at home and abroad is entwinedMuch of Biden\'s overseas leverage in coming days depends on how he is perceived by US allies and foes after a year in office.The biggest blemish on his record so far is the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan. The President had pledged to Americans there would be no Saigon-style exit from Kabul, yet that\'s what happened. Administration claims that the hurried evacuation was a massive success were undercut by video footage of what was really happening -- and the deaths of 13 US service members and many more Afghans in a suicide bombing outside the airport. The debacle dented Biden\'s authority at home and abroad, despite claims by Democrats that Americans didn\'t really care how US troops left the nation\'s longest war and that they just wanted them home. The mess also offered an opening for Republicans to brand the new President as feckless -- even though those GOP critics were quiet when Trump was genuflecting to global tyrants. In foreign capitals, the withdrawal that came with little warning for allies raised new questions about US staying power. As did Biden\'s cold-eyed view of US interests.Biden grapples with a Covid-19 testing failure that could have been foreseenTortured domestic politics are also hampering Biden\'s bid to put a stamp on the world. While his swift return to the Paris climate agreement pleased America\'s friends, his capacity to keep commitments is in doubt after West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin said he couldn\'t vote for the President\'s Build Back Better plan, which includes a historic $500 billion investment in fighting global warming. Biden\'s attempt to enlist the world\'s democracies in a quest to preserve the liberal world order is, meanwhile, constantly undermined by Trump\'s incessant attempts to destroy American democracy. And the prospect that the 45th President could return to the White House in 2025 means many foreign powers doubt Biden\'s promise that America is back.Presidents under fire at home often seek easy wins abroad, but Biden lacks such a luxury since he is serving when America\'s global power is more challenged than at any time since World War II. At the same time, raging US political divisions back in the United States offer openings to adversaries like Putin and Xi. It\'s a vicious circle that plays into the hands of Republicans determined to portray Biden as a weak failure. So, as tough as 2022 promises to be for Biden at home, he\'s unlikely to get much relief overseas.CNN\'s Natasha Bertrand and Kyle Feldscher contributed to this report.

Reid underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer in 2018 and said less than a year later that he was in remission. At the time, he told CNN\'s Dana Bash that he felt ""very good"" and that he was ""doing fine."" But Reid responded to his cancer diagnosis with his usual bluntness, telling The New York Times in 2019: ""As soon as you discover you have something on your pancreas, you\'re dead."" From modest beginnings to the US Senate The beginning of Reid\'s life didn\'t hint at his political future. Born in 1939 in a modest home with no running water, his mother once earned money by doing laundry for local brothels, he wrote in his memoir, ""The Good Fight,"" while his father worked as a hard-rock miner. He attended high school in Henderson, Nevada, often hitchhiking the 45-mile route. A boxer in his youth, Reid later attended Utah State University before moving to Washington, DC, and working his way through law school at George Washington University by working as an officer for the United States Capitol Police. ""I think I am the only former Capitol policeman here that is a senator,"" Reid said in 2011. ""I have such great respect for the work that they do.""  Photos: Former US Sen.

A year earlier, he underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer.Hide Caption 33 of 33After law school, Reid returned to Nevada and served as lieutenant governor from 1971 to 1975, the youngest person elected to that role in the state. After losing reelection, Reid served as chair of the Nevada Gaming Commission, a powerful position that oversees and regulates the state\'s casino industry. The job made Reid and his family a target of the mob: After he left that post, his wife found a bomb in the family\'s car, Reid wrote in his memoir. Reid\'s political career grew with Nevada. When the state went from one congressional district to two after the 1980 census, Reid ran for a newly created congressional district around Las Vegas in 1982 and won the general election. He was reelected in 1984. He then successfully ran for Nevada\'s open Senate seat in 1986.  He rose through the leadership ranks there, serving as the chamber\'s Democratic whip from 1999 to 2005. From 2005 through his retirement in 2017, he served as his party\'s leader in the Senate, through Democrats\' time in both the minority and the majority. Playing politics  As the chamber\'s Democratic leader, Reid was a polarizing figure. Republicans argued much of the congressional gridlock stemmed from his hard-ball tactics, but Reid often reveled in playing the political bad guy -- even calling then-President George W. Bush a ""loser"" and a ""liar."" (Later, when Donald Trump was in the White House, Reid told CNN\'s Bash that he wished for Bush ""every day."") Reid is often blamed for deepening an era of political polarization with irascible rhetoric about Republicans and the use of controversial Senate procedures that left traditionalists worried that the consensus that once made the chamber special had vanished forever.  He brought those same tactics to electoral politics, too. During Obama\'s reelection bid in 2012, Reid accused Republican nominee Mitt Romney, with no evidence, of not paying his taxes. Asked by CNN in 2015 whether he regretted the attack, Reid said, ""I don\'t regret that at all."" ""Romney didn\'t win, did he?"" Reid asked rhetorically. As much as he irked Republicans, he was often cheered by Democrats for being the last line of defense to Bush and other Republicans. He was a staunch defender of social programs and, reflecting wishes of the large Latino community back home, a proponent of immigration reform.  Reid shepherded the centerpieces of Obama\'s liberal political legacy into law, and he said one of his proudest accomplishments had been encouraging then-Sen. Obama to run for president.  ""I did call him into my office and told him he should take a look at it. And he was stunned because I was the first one that ever suggested that to him,"" Reid told CNN in 2015.  ""When he was reelected, (that was) one of the most moving phone calls I\'ve ever received because he said, you know, \'You\'re the reason I\'m here,\'"" Reid recalled. Obama reiterated that sentiment in the letter he sent to Reid released Tuesday evening. ""Here\'s what I want you to know. You were a great leader in the Senate, and early on you were more generous to me than I had any right to expect,"" Obama wrote.""As different as we are, I think we both saw something of ourselves in each other - a couple of outsiders who had defied the odds and knew how to take a punch and cared about the little guy. And you know what, we made for a pretty good team,"" he added.Former President Bill Clinton also lauded Reid, remembering him as ""one of the most effective Senate leaders our country has ever known.""""We will likely never see another public servant quite like him—in personality, command of strategy and tactics, and assuredness in marching to the beat of his own drum,"" Clinton said in a statement.In the darkest hours of the Great Recession, Reid ushered a nearly $800 billion economic stimulus plan through the Senate despite insurmountable rows with most Republicans, who said it was too expensive and racked up too much debt.  Later, he piloted the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, through the Senate using a controversial budget maneuver known as reconciliation to bypass a Republican filibuster, and he told the GOP to ""stop crying"" about it.  ""Senator Harry Reid was a leader of immense courage and ferocious conviction who worked tirelessly to achieve historic progress for the American people,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who, as the House\'s top Democrat for the last 20 years, worked with Reid across the Capitol. ""Over more than four decades of public service, Senator Reid was guided always by his North Star: to improve the lives of working families like his own,"" she added in a statement reflecting on his death. In modern-day Washington, the former senator\'s impact is perhaps most present in his 2013 change to the Senate rules to prevent filibusters of most executive branch nominations. He told CNN last year that he ""absolutely"" doesn\'t regret changing the rules at the time, saying: ""I have no regret. It was the right thing to do. And by the way, it\'s not the first time the rules have been changed. They\'ve been changed lots of times. It was time to do it again.""  Broad use of the filibuster has soared in recent years in an increasingly polarized Congress. The shift prompted Reid to pen an opinion piece in the New York Times in 2019 calling for an end to the filibuster altogether.  ""During the two decades we served together in the United States Senate, and the eight years we worked together while I served as Vice President, Harry met the marker for what I\'ve always believed is the most important thing by which you can measure a person—their action and their word,"" Biden said in his Tuesday statement.""If Harry said he would do something, he did it. If he gave you his word, you could bank on it. That\'s how he got things done for the good of the country for decades,"" the President added.Despite his blunt political style, Reid inspired fierce respect from many of his longtime aides, as well as fellow lawmakers -- even those across the aisle.  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who was frequently at odds with Reid during their lengthy careers, remembered him as a ""one-of-a-kind"" senator, saying their relationship had transcended political fights.""The nature of Harry\'s and my jobs brought us into frequent and sometimes intense conflict over politics and policy. But I never doubted that Harry was always doing what he earnestly, deeply felt was right for Nevada and our country,"" the Kentucky Republican said. ""He will rightly go down in history as a crucial, pivotal figure in the development and history of his beloved home state.""Reid told CNN earlier this year that he has ""a lot of respect"" for John Boehner, the former Republican House speaker from Ohio with whom he sparred for years, as he reacted to excerpts of Boehner\'s memoir and lambasted the Republican Party\'s more recent ""tribal"" turn.   ""The deal is this. John Boehner and I got a lot done, but we didn\'t mince words,"" he said.  Love and legacy Despite Reid\'s reputation as a hard bargainer with no qualms about scrapping with his opponents, he was also known as a romantic and the most influential person in his life was his wife, Landra. The two met in high school when Reid was 15. Her father was so opposed to the two dating that Reid and his would-be father-in-law got into a fist fight early in their courtship. Reid, who was raised agnostic, told Bash in 2015 that their opposition was that they wanted their daughter to marry someone Jewish. They eloped in 1959 during college, converting to Mormonism a year later. Her parents finally came around on him. ""I am a blessed man to have this 5-foot tall woman with me all these years,"" said Reid.  The former Senate majority leader credited one thing for his political success over the years: Hard work.  ""I didn\'t make it in life because of my athletic prowess. I didn\'t make it because of my good looks. I didn\'t make it because I\'m a genius,"" he said in his farewell address on the Senate floor in 2016. ""I made it because I worked hard.""  Reid\'s most lasting legacy is likely to be felt in Nevada, where the senator not only remade the Western state, but turned it into a Democratic stronghold that last backed a Republican president in 2004.  ""The little boy from Searchlight has been able to be part of a changing state of Nevada,"" he said in his farewell address in 2016. Reid was instrumental in pushing Democrats to make Nevada one of the first nominating contests in the country, a move that focused Democratic attention on Nevada and was a catalyst to its leftward shift. He often pushed Democrats to make Nevada even more important, urging the party, because of the state\'s diversity, to move the state before Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states in the nominating process. He also used his power to lift up the careers of younger politicians, like Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, whom the former Senate majority leader recruited to run for his seat when he was retiring in 2016.""Harry Reid was a champion for Nevada, helping preserve our precious environmental treasures, strengthen our rural communities, and build up our great cities,"" Cortez Masto recalled in a statement on Tuesday. ""The American people are better off because of the leadership of Senator Harry Reid.""In recognition of the impact Reid had on Nevada, the Clark County Board of Commissioners voted earlier this year in favor of renaming McCarran International Airport to Harry Reid International Airport. Reid reflected on his life -- and the role he played in changing Nevada -- when he received a lifetime achievement award from the Nevada Democratic Party in 2019. ""It\'s a long way from Searchlight to Washington,"" he said. ""But I didn\'t get there alone. I got there because of you, Nevadans."" This story has been updated with additional information.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN)As President Biden struggles through the roughest patch of his presidency yet -- with his poll numbers in the doldrums and the cornerstone of his Build Back Better legislation in peril -- he can look back at one unalloyed success in his first year. The Senate has confirmed a record number of his nominees to the federal judiciary -- the most of any president at this stage in 40 years -- and at a time when that achievement matters more than ever. In its final days in session for the year, the Senate confirmed 10 district judges, giving Biden a total of 40 confirmations, a tie with Ronald Reagan\'s record. By comparison, the Senate confirmed 18 circuit and district court judges in President Donald Trump\'s first year in office, and 12 in President Barack Obama\'s first year. Biden\'s achievement is especially important at a time when partisanship in the judiciary is nearly as pervasive as it is in the political branches.Republicans learned this lesson before Democrats did. When Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican, was Senate majority leader during the Trump years, he put judicial confirmations at the top of his agenda. Thanks to McConnell, the Senate confirmed 54 appellate judges during Trump\'s one term, just one fewer than Obama appointed in his two terms. McConnell\'s Supreme CourtIn overall numbers, according to Pew Research Center, Trump\'s total of 226 in his single term is below the totals of recent two-term presidents, including Obama (320), George W. Bush (322) and Bill Clinton (367). But according to a Washington Post analysis, Trump appointed the youngest group of judges since at least the start of the 20th century. The average age of his appellate court judges was 47, about five years younger than Obama\'s appellate judges. Since all federal judges enjoy life tenure, Trump created a legacy that would be difficult to reverse.But Biden -- with the crucial assistance of Chuck Schumer, the current Senate majority leader, and Richard Durbin, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee -- has fought back. While the Senate has struggled to move much of Biden\'s legislative agenda, Schumer has filled the time with confirmations, and his fellow Democrats (including the otherwise resistant Joe Manchin and Krysten Sinema) have confirmed every one. Biden\'s judges so far are generally younger and more diverse than even Obama\'s were. For example, according to figures compiled by the American Constitution Society, about 80 percent of Biden\'s judicial nominees have been women, compared to 42 percent for Obama and 24 percent for Trump. About 36 percent of Obama\'s nominees were members of minority groups, compared to about 67 percent for Biden, and 16 percent for Trump. And Biden has drawn from a broader pool of lawyers, too. Obama chose a great many former prosecutors for the bench, Biden has looked to defense lawyers as well. Halfway into his first year, Biden\'s legacy in this regard is formidable already.Read MoreOpinion: Clarence Thomas Is the new Chief Justice Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. has famously asserted that our nation\'s judges are independent of politics and ""dedicated"" to nonpartisanship. ""We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges,"" he said. But in recent years the difference between Democratic and Republican judicial appointees has been vast and growing. This is not because the judges are unethical or partisan hacks (at least most of them), but rather because judicial philosophy and political orientation have rarely been as closely aligned as they are today. Democrats and Republicans simply have different and profound disagreements about what the Constitution means.Consider several recent legal controversies. In October, Robert Pitman, an Obama appointee to the federal district court in Texas, ruled that the state\'s draconian anti-abortion rights law known as SB 8 was unconstitutional. Republican-appointed judges overturned him. Similarly, four Democratic appointees have ruled against Trump\'s effort to prevent Congress from gaining access to executive branch records in the investigation of the January 6 riot at the Capitol: The district court ruling was by an Obama appointee, and it was affirmed by a DC Circuit panel of two Obama judges and one Biden judge. Republican-appointed judges have, in turn, stymied Democratic priorities, as when a three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit rejected the Biden administration\'s vaccine mandate for large employers. The judges were one Reagan and two Trump appointees. Attorney General Merrick Garland, don\'t prosecute Donald Trump Of course, one Trump record that Biden cannot hope to equal involves the most important federal court of all. McConnell\'s most consequential acts as majority leader allowed Trump to fill three seats on the Supreme Court. McConnell forbade consideration of Merrick Garland as a replacement for Antonin Scalia during the last year of Obama\'s presidency, paving the way for Trump to nominate Neil Gorsuch in his inaugural year. He then steered Brett Kavanaugh through a tumultuous confirmation and then jammed through the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett in the waning days of Trump\'s presidency. The Supreme Court is now the most partisan of federal courts, one with a clear conservative majority on such issues as abortion, affirmative action, gun safety and many others. Even if Stephen Breyer, the 83-year-old liberal, retires in the next year and Biden replaces him, the current President cannot reasonably hope to change that lineup in the near future.Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion\'s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookAnd Biden\'s first-term record of judicial accomplishment stands on a fragile base as well. If the Democrats lose even a single Senate seat in the 2022 midterms (as historical trends suggest they will), McConnell will again be majority leader and in a position to bring judicial confirmations to a halt. Certainly, McConnell will not allow Biden to fill a seat on the Supreme Court. That means Biden, along with Schumer and Durbin, will have to keep up the same pace of appointing and confirming judges in the next year if they want a legacy that even Mitch McConnell can\'t undo.', 'Did Joe Manchin just sink Biden\'s plan?

(CNN) With his announcement on ""Fox News Sunday"" that he will not vote for President Joe Biden\'s Build Back Better plan, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) has handed the White House not just a lump of coal this Christmas, but an entire strip mine. Paul Begala The reaction was immediate and fierce. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), the chair of the Senate Budget Committee, blasted his more conservative colleague (but, to be fair, all 99 of Sanders\' colleagues are more conservative than he). Sanders told CNN\'s Jake Tapper that if Manchin ""doesn\'t have the courage to do the right thing for the working families of West Virginia and America, let him vote no in front of the whole world.""   It appears Manchin is prepared to do just that. As a veteran of countless make-or-break moments on Capitol Hill and in the White House, I know that Biden and the Democrats have multiple paths forward. Read More First, I must note that this is not the biggest setback Joe Biden has faced in his life, and each time he has come back stronger. The political graveyards are filled with people who underestimated Joe Biden. Beneath the genial visage is a spine of steel. As Oliver Wendell Holmes said of his fellow Civil War veterans, Biden\'s heart has been ""touched with fire."" It will not break from this blow. Perhaps Manchin is being tactical. Perhaps there is still some version of BBB he can support. If so, his support will brand the bill as moderate -- with a capital M. Not the worst thing going into an election year in which moderate voters in swing districts will decide the outcome.  If, instead, Manchin has pulled the plug on Build Back Better, Biden still has several paths to success: Piecemeal. The size and scope of BBB, which thrilled progressives, may have ultimately sunk it with Manchin. The White House website extolls the virtues of 22 different provisions in BBB. Twenty-two. Woodrow Wilson thought he could remake the world after World War I with just 14 points. And the Good Lord himself thought we could govern ourselves with 10. Biden could break BBB up into those 22 component parts and introduce them separately. Not all will pass, of course, especially since it will take 60 votes to break filibuster, while the BBB requires only 50 votes under reconciliation. Maybe none will, given some Democrats\' absurd fealty to the filibuster. But you never know.  Biden must show Manchin and Sinema he can play hardballWhen my old boss, Bill Clinton, crashed and burned in his attempt to pass national health care, the Comeback Kid came back with the Children\'s Health Insurance Plan, tougher nursing home standards, expanded options for people with breast and cervical cancer, improved food safety, expanded childhood immunizations, a massive increase in medical research funding, and waged war on Big Tobacco. All of those were a far cry from universal health care, but they were progress, and Clinton is a progressive. Even if we fail, Clinton used to say to me, ""there\'s nothin\' wrong with getting caught tryin\'.""Executive Orders. President Barack Obama also came back after a massive setback -- in his case, on immigration. He failed in his attempt to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Then he failed in his attempt to pass the DREAM Act, which would have legalized the status of those who had come to America without papers as young children. Democrats -- on background, of course -- excoriated Obama, telling Newsweek that Obama\'s efforts on immigration were ""a disaster.""  ""I campaigned for him,"" one said. ""I put my reputation on line. He either didn\'t know what he was doing or he lied, because he has not done what he said he would do. I\'m ashamed."" Undeterred by the friendly fire, Obama pressed on. In 2012 he signed an executive order known as DACA -- Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. The order allowed young ""Dreamers"" to legally work in the United States and prohibited their deportation. Take it to the Voters. The news, of course, is all about Manchin. But it is vital for Biden and the Democrats to explain to voters why Manchin has so much power: The reason Biden must get every single Democrat is that the GOP won\'t let him get even a single Republican. How is it that out of 50 Republican senators not one is for a child tax credit -- a middle-class tax cut to help families make ends meet?  Not even one Republican is for making child care more affordable, or home care for your elderly parents and grandparents. Not even one Republican is for universal pre-K, or tax breaks for middle class families who want to buy an electric car or install solar panels on their roof. Not even one Republican is for negotiating for cheaper prescription drugs in Medicare, or for lower premiums under Obamacare, or for covering hearing aids under Medicare. Not even one Republican wants to expand a tax credit that rewards people who choose work over welfare -- an idea that Ronald Reagan championed. Not even one Republican is for more affordable housing, or better nutrition for children. Biden should tell his fellow Americans that he wouldn\'t even need Joe Manchin if he could get a few Republicans to actually stand up for work, for middle-class tax cuts, for green jobs.

Needless to say, none of these options is attractive. Each has a serious risk of failure.

But Democrats in the Senate and the White House, though they\'ve come off the November elections more worried in recent weeks about a potential wipeout in the midterms, are still avoiding calling directly for Breyer to quit, fearing that it would backfire and encourage the 83-year-old to stay on the bench.Breyer has told several people who\'ve made unofficial efforts to push him to retire that he thinks the confirmation process shouldn\'t be political, according to people told of those discussions, and Democrats worry he\'d remain as an act of resistance to show he\'s not bowing to politics.Still, top Democrats across Washington would like Breyer to announce he\'s going even before the end of the court term in June, so they can get moving on confirmation hearings well before the midterms. More than the political calendar is on their minds -- with their 50-50 margin and several aging Senate Democrats coming from states with Republican governors, they head into the new year fearing that their control of the chamber could collapse at any moment. Read MoreStephen Breyer says now isn\'t the time to lose faith in the Supreme CourtPrivately, multiple Senate Democrats complain that Breyer seems to have let his ego overtake him and he is not being realistic to how radically Supreme Court confirmation politics has changed in the last five years. Publicly, they continue to approach Breyer gingerly. Asked if the 50-50 Senate divide, the health of his colleagues and Breyer\'s own health should accelerate the justice\'s timeline, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse chose his words carefully, noting that he\'d deliberately avoided calling for Breyer\'s retirement. ""I would hope,"" the Rhode Island Democrat finally said, ""the choice and its consequences are apparent to the justice.""And the White House is stuck in the middle, with the President adamant that Breyer should get to make his own decision.Biden has so far avoided the kind of pressure that Barack Obama tried to exert on Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2013, when the President hosted the aging justice at the White House for lunch to nudge her toward the exit. But in the West Wing and among civil rights leaders, the frustration is about more than just a Supreme Court seat: every day that Breyer remains on the bench is a day that Biden isn\'t able to fulfill his campaign pledge to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court. Members of the Supreme Court pose for a group photo in April. There are also the political considerations, with Democrats eager to excite their base ahead of next year\'s elections.  ""The President made a bold commitment,"" said National Urban League President Marc Morial. ""I hope it would add to the thinking to make that kind of history."" Republicans ready for replay of Merrick Garland pickMeanwhile, Senate Republicans aren\'t shy about laying out how they\'d handle a nomination from Biden if they take the majority: They wouldn\'t.""You know what the rule is on that,"" said Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee. ""You go back to 1886 and ever since then, when the Senate\'s been of one party and the president\'s been of another party, you didn\'t confirm.""There is no such rule.Senate Republicans have invoked a number of what they call ""rules"" in recent years to explain, for example, refusing to hold confirmation hearings for Merrick Garland, the now-attorney general who was Obama\'s choice to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, or their rushing to confirm Justice Amy Coney Barrett, President Donald Trump\'s choice to replace Ginsburg. But the then-Democratic majority Senate voted to confirm President Ronald Reagan\'s nomination of Anthony Kennedy in 1988 and President George H.W. Bush\'s nomination of David Souter in 1990 and Clarence Thomas in 1991, all while Grassley was in the Senate. Back then, the Judiciary Committee chairman was a senator from Delaware named Joe Biden.While Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has sought to downplay this talk -- ""I\'m not going to start talking about what might happen if I\'m the majority leader,"" he said last week when asked about Supreme Court nominations -- he was the mastermind of the GOP efforts to upend the confirmation process to seize seats. And many of his members were more willing to discuss where this is headed, particularly if the seat were to come open in 2023 or 2024, when they would use being in a presidential election cycle to make a similar justification for stonewalling a pick as McConnell did in 2016.Then-President Barack Obama joins then-Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland during his nomination announcement in March 2016. ""Constitutionally, the Senate has an obligation to advise and consent. The Senate can take up nominations when it wants to,"" said GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. Not that most Republicans could imagine supporting a Biden nominee at any point.""Given the pattern of judicial nominees he\'s put forward so far, he keeps being captive to the radical left in his party. If he nominated a radical leftist justice who would ignore the rule of law and undermine our constitutional rights, I can\'t imagine a Republican Senate would confirm an extreme justice,"" said Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Sen. Thom Tillis, a member of the Judiciary Committee, said Republicans would make a choice if they didn\'t like a Biden pick: ""Either don\'t move on him or have him fail in committee.""""It\'s not our intention to rubber stamp nominees,"" the North Carolina Republican said.  McConnell\'s Supreme CourtSen. John Cornyn, who sits on the committee but also is a member of leadership, said how the GOP would act on a nominee depends on when a vacancy would occur.""Usually if we are in the majority and Biden is still in office, what that produces is a negotiation,"" the Texas Republican said. ""I haven\'t really thought about filing the vacancy or not, so I think a lot of that has to do when in that two years of time it occurs.""Cornyn added: ""The later it occurs in his term, the less likely it will be; the earlier, more likely.""Sens. John Kennedy of Louisiana and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, both Judiciary Committee members, declined to comment on whether they\'d be willing to consider a Biden nominee for the Supreme Court. When asked if there\'s a Biden nominee he could envision supporting, Cotton suppressed a chuckle. Democrats scramble for a responseDemocrats have struggled to respond to Republicans\' escalation of Supreme Court partisan warfare. Many who presume Breyer will announce that he\'s retiring in June also presumed he was going to announce he\'d quit this past June. He\'s been on the court since 1994, confirmed a few months before the massive Republican wave in that year\'s midterms, and is quickly moving up the ranks of the longest serving justices ever (he\'s currently at No. 23).  ""I\'m deeply concerned,"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who\'s a member of the Judiciary Committee, said when asked about a Breyer retirement in a GOP majority. ""In effect, the threat of Republican control in the Senate is a dagger aimed at the heart of the Supreme Court, which would be potentially out of balance and out of the mainstream if there are more right-wing ideologues appointed.""Blumenthal said he is not urging Breyer to retire but added: ""I\'m just hoping he assesses as strategically and intelligently as I know he will do ... the potential dangers of a GOP majority."" Justice Stephen Breyer speaks during an interview on ""The David Rubenstein Show"" in New York, in September. In public interviews in recent months, Breyer has also downplayed America\'s current divisions, arguing the country has survived other tough times in the past.Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, often talks to colleagues about how they\'re ""a heartbeat"" away from the minority with the current 50-50 Senate. Privately, multiple Democratic senators acknowledge that -- with seven of their members over age 70 coming from states with Republican governors who\'d get to appoint replacements -- they worry how right, literally, he\'ll turn out to be. Those senators include Sens. Bernie Sanders and Patrick Leahy from Vermont, who are both over 80 and have been suddenly hospitalized in recent years -- Sanders for his heart attack in October 2019 and Leahy for feeling ""unwell"" last January. ""Absolutely,"" said Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, when asked if it were a real worry when looking around at the number of his aging colleagues from states with Republican governors. ""No question about it."" A spokesman for Leahy, who as the then-Judiciary Committee chairman tried to encourage Ginsburg to step down before Obama invited her to lunch to ramp up the pressure, didn\'t respond to an emailed question about whether the senator thinks Breyer should step down now. But Leahy\'s announcement last month that he won\'t seek another term has only increased anxiety about his health among colleagues.  Not only did Republicans seize the opportunities created by Scalia\'s and Ginsburg\'s deaths, but Trump\'s White House counsel carefully worked Kennedy to retire on their timeline ahead of the 2018 midterms, assuring him that he\'d want to guarantee that another conservative took his spot. The secret Supreme Court: Late nights, courtesy votes and the unwritten 6-vote rule ""Clearly the examples of Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kennedy put in very plain relief what the difference can be for the make-up of the court,"" said Whitehouse, the Rhode Island Democrat who\'s become a leading voice for changes at the Supreme Court. ""Breyer may pine for a time that never was -- a fantasy era when judicial selection wasn\'t political,"" said Robert Raben, an assistant attorney general in the Clinton administration who has since become an advocate for increasing diversity on the bench. ""That\'s a chimera, and we on the left need to accept the fact that if you\'re assigned a bill number and marked up in a committee, it\'s politics.""Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar told CNN over the summer that she hoped Breyer would retire ""sooner rather than later."" Those feelings have spread and intensified among her colleagues in the months since, and Senate Democratic leaders have already had preliminary discussions about how they would conduct a confirmation process, according to people involved.A close eye on Breyer When Breyer sat for a round of interviews this summer to promote his new book, White House aides carefully parsed his answers about potential retirement, including when he told CNN that both his health and his new position as the court\'s senior liberal would weigh on his thinking. Later he expanded further to the New York Times, saying he would factor in who was choosing his successor when making a decision about stepping down.Justice Breyer says return to in-person Supreme Court arguments is a \'big improvement\'The comments led to rounds of speculation among some Biden advisers of what Breyer\'s intentions really were as it became clear the justice would not retire ahead of this year\'s term. Some viewed the comments as a sign he was taking into consideration the make up of the Senate.Asked in October about calls for him to retire while the Democrats were secure in their Senate majority, Breyer told CNN, ""That\'s their point of view,"" adding, ""I think I have most of the considerations in mind. I simply have to weigh them and think about them and decide when the proper time is."" Breyer said he does not want to die on the court. Presented with the history of previous justices giving early word of their retirements to presidents, Breyer said, ""I\'ve looked through the various practices."" In some years, justices who are planning to retire at the end of the term have told the president several months ahead of time.Still, among many Democrats close to and inside the White House, Breyer\'s decision to remain on the bench this year was a serious disappointment. Inside the White House, the prospect of a Breyer retirement has been simmering underneath the surface since nearly the moment Biden took office. Among other factors, it\'s hard to press an 83-year-old justice to retire when Biden says he\'s planning to run for reelection when he will be in his early 80s himself. Then-Supreme Court Justice nominee Stephen Breyer meets with then-Sen. Joe Biden meet in Biden\'s office on Capitol Hill in May 1994.Various candidates to replace Breyer have been suggested to Dana Remus, the White House counsel, by Democrats close to Biden, who are eager to put forward names. Biden allies have also approached Vice President Kamala Harris and members of her team with candidates. There\'s even been outside rumor mongering that Biden could appoint Harris.Among members of Biden\'s senior team, at least one maintains a close connection to Breyer: national security adviser Jake Sullivan, who clerked for the justice in the early 2000s. Sullivan\'s wife, Maggie Goodlander, also clerked for Breyer three years ago and Breyer attended their wedding on the campus of Yale Law School in 2015. White House chief of staff Ron Klain, who was a top Senate Judiciary Committee staffer under Biden and has been hyper-focused on judicial nominations since the beginning of this presidency, has a decades-long friendship with Justice Elena Kagan, one Breyer\'s few fellow liberals still on the court. Thinking back on that lunch attempting to nudge Ginsburg in 2013, several Obama aides note that the former President turned out to be justified in his interest in seeing her retire while Democrats had the majority. Biden has insisted on a more hands-off approach to Breyer. ""The President\'s view is that any considerations about potential retirements are solely and entirely up to justices themselves,"" said White House spokesman Andrew Bates. Anxiety about potential backfire from pushing Breyer to retire also comes up often in discussions with top West Wing aides, according to several who\'ve had those conversation. Most of the speculation on a potential pick focuses on Ketanji Brown Jackson, confirmed this spring for the DC circuit court of appeals, a traditional feeder for the Supreme Court. A former Breyer clerk, she has already been vetted by the Biden team and interviewed by the President and has been supported in the past by former House Speaker Paul Ryan, a prominent Republican who is related to her by marriage.California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger is also discussed. She is seen as helped by being well liked among the alumni of the solicitor general\'s office, where she was a top official in the Obama administration. She has not, however, been as thoroughly vetted. Biden Supreme Court commission\'s draft report details \'profound\' disagreement over adding seats to benchOther names currently circulating: Minnesota district court Judge Mimi Wright, outgoing NAACP Legal Defense Fund President Sherrilyn Ifill, Second Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Eunice Lee, Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Candace Jackson-Akiwumi, and J. Michelle Childs, a South Carolina judge who\'s been pushed by House Majority Whip James Clyburn and whose nomination is currently pending for a Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals seat. Clyburn, notably, gave Biden the endorsement that helped salvage his campaign in the 2020 primaries after getting him to promise to appoint a Black woman.  Clyburn, who has previously said he didn\'t think it was his place to call for Breyer\'s retirement (and who\'s 81 himself), is sticking by that position, according to an aide.Process becomes a problemEven if Breyer announces his retirement in the spring and they\'re still in the majority, Democratic senators and top aides on Capitol Hill worry about how long confirmation could take, between the regular order of the process and expected GOP efforts to slow it down. Republicans ""use power maximally especially as it relates to the judiciary, and I think we should expect nothing different going forward,"" said Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii.  And, as with everything these days, Democrats worry about securing votes from Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.The current Supreme Court\'s partisan moment rivals Bush v. GoreRepublicans have also proven much more adept at activating their base voters around Supreme Court confirmations, whether when Scalia\'s seat was in the balance in the 2016 elections, when Brett Kavanaugh\'s confirmation hearings exploded ahead of the 2018 elections or when Barrett was rushed onto the bench ahead of the 2020 elections. Democrats warn against thinking that they\'d be the ones who would benefit politically from a retirement ahead of an election, even with a historic pick and potentially momentous abortion ruling motivating their base. The threat to Roe. v. Wade is another reason why they want Breyer to announce he\'s leaving ahead of schedule.""Securing the seat is more important than trying to be cute about the timing for some midterm impact,"" said Brian Fallon, the executive director of Demand Justice, a Democratic group focused on judicial nominations. In 2016, McConnell\'s refusal to at least give confirmation hearings to Obama\'s nominee left the seat open for almost a year, enraging Senate Democrats and making several of his own Republican members deeply uncomfortable. Republicans say they\'re now ready to leave a seat open for years, if that\'s what it would take to wait out a Democrat in the White House. And the stakes could get even higher, if future election challenges make their way to the Supreme Court, which would have an even number of justices if Breyer is no longer in his spot. Sen. Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican who doesn\'t sit on the committee, believes it\'s ""unlikely"" Republicans would keep a seat vacant for two years.""I would presume we\'d go for the hearings and make a decision,"" Romney said. ""By the way, we might vote no, but we might as well have a hearing and make a decision.""  Multiple Republican senators say they\'d rather avoid the kind of showdown that a retirement would set off in a GOP majority, or in a presidential election year -- or both.""If he\'s going to retire, he needs to retire next year,"" said South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, the former Judiciary Committee chairman. ""It would be a lot easier.""Joan Biskupic and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.

It\'s no surprise Larry Summers finds something for both sides of the fight over President Joe Biden\'s policies.The eminent Democratic economist has done it all year. In May, he warned that Biden\'s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan risked over-stimulating the economy and sparking inflation; Republicans have invoked those warnings ever since.Yet Summers also says Congress should pass Biden\'s $1.9 trillion Build Back Better Plan over GOP opposition because it would boost long-term growth without significantly increasing inflation. Democratic leaders have crossed their fingers that West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin listens.Lately, economic data offers cross-cutting superlatives nearly every day. Last week, new unemployment claims fell to a 50-year low -- just before data releasd on Friday showed monthly inflation for November registered a 40-year high.Summers, a former top economic adviser to Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, sees neither unalloyed prosperity nor dangerous decline. Instead, he acknowledges immense uncertainty that allows for either outcome or something in between.Read MoreThe inflation spike Summers sounded early alarms about has dominated political debate in recent months. Fueled by a vexing combination of elevated demand and constrained supply, higher prices for gas, food, appliances and shelter have outstripped the wage increases Biden has touted. They\'ve also eroded Biden\'s approval ratings and darkened Democratic prospects in 2022 congressional elections.But the economy has also shown important strengths in its recovery from the coronavirus calamity. The Federal Reserve projects 2021 growth at 5.9%, the highest since 1984, as the US became the first advanced industrial economy to return output to pre-pandemic levels. Employers have added 6 million jobs, more than in any other president\'s first year.Unemployment has fallen to 4.2% three years before economists previously expected. Covid relief checks have boosted household income higher than before coronavirus. Even the thorniest immediate problems -- supply chain kinks and high oil prices -- have begun easing.Summers acknowledges that the rescue plan he criticized has lifted growth and employment. And though workers\' wages overall have lost ground to inflation, wages of lower-paid workers have run ahead -- a small step toward the Democratic goal of curbing income inequality.But he fears sustained inflation will render those gains fleeting. The tighter monetary policy the Federal Reserve has signaled to cool the economy could have unpredictable and painful effects.""The economy would be weaker right now"" without Biden\'s rescue plan, Summers conceded in an interview. ""If I drive 90 mph, I will get to New York faster. But I\'m at higher risk of crashing.""We\'re going to have to slow the car in a controlled way,"" he added. ""It may not be so easy.""Currently, Summers pegs chances at 50% that inflation will settle in at perhaps twice the Fed\'s 2% target -- for years. If the problem snowballs anything like it did in the 1970s, when expectations of higher prices became self-fulfilling, taming it could force an excruciating downturn.Summers sees a 30% chance that Fed tightening will trigger another recession, just three years from the last one, within the next 18 months. His least likely scenario -- a 20% chance -- is that the Federal Reserve pumps the brakes skillfully enough that demand and supply resolve imbalances harmoniously enough to sustain growth.White House economists, and some on Wall Street, paint a more hopeful picture. It begins with vaccinations taming the pandemic and tempering inflation in multiple ways: by reducing Covid-related production bottlenecks, drawing more workers to the labor force, shifting consumption back toward services and away from goods as normal life returns. As supply expands, the end of Covid relief will moderate demand.Summers calls that too sanguine. To begin with, the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus underscores the possibility that the pandemic may resist taming indefinitely.Moreover, Summers notes that the earnings of those returning workers will themselves increase demand. So will spending by Americans who so far have saved big chunks of those relief checks.""The notion that the end of the pandemic is going to be inherently deflationary is a confusion,"" Summers said.The steps he recommends to reduce inflation risks lack political appeal. One is eliminating the full or partial restoration of federal deductions for state and local income taxes - which House Democrats say has become essential to amassing the votes for Biden\'s Build Back Better bill.Another is adding more tax hikes on corporations - which Senate Democrats fear would also sink the bill by losing the vote of Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema. A third is lifting import tariffs on China -- which for foreign policy and domestic political reasons Biden won\'t do anytime soon.Summers allows that economic good fortune could render his warnings overblown. ""I don\'t want to over-argue my case,"" he said.Maybe Americans have grown so accustomed to low inflation that behavior-altering ""inflation expectations"" won\'t take off. Maybe new remote-work arrangements forced by the pandemic will produce efficiency gains as technological advances did in the 1990s.Even such a ""soft landing"" may not save Democrats next year, since voter attitudes rarely improve as fast as the economy itself. What has lifted struggling presidents before are foreign policy crises or other unexpected events that quickly reframe the political agenda.""The picture,"" Summers observed, ""is a long way from frozen.""']","['Kamala Harris to name Jamal Simmons as communications directorBy Jasmine Wright, CNNUpdated 12:40 PM ET, Thu January 6, 2022 NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 27:  Jamal Simmons speaks onstage at the Elections 2016: The Wild Ride to the White House panel on the Times Center Stage during 2016 Advertising Week New York on September 27, 2016 in New York City.

Etienne departed the office in November to pursue ""other opportunities,"" a White House official told CNN at the time. Etienne\'s exit had been a long time coming, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN at the time.The following month, CNN was first to report Symone Sanders was leaving Harris\' office, vacating her role as senior adviser and chief spokesperson. A replacement for Sanders has still not been named.The news of Simmons\' selection comes after two staffers announced Wednesday that they are leaving Harris\' office. Peter Velz, Harris\' director of press operations, shared news of his departure from the White House, which was first reported by Politico, in a series of tweets. Velz said he was leaving the White House to join the protocol team at the State Department, where he said he\'s ""excited to continue supporting the @VP and @POTUS for their meetings with foreign leaders, delegations, and international travel.""Vincent Evans, who serves as Harris\' deputy director of public engagement and intergovernmental affairs, also announced he will move to the Congressional Black Caucus, where he\'ll serve as executive director.Staff shakeups after the first year of an administration are not unprecedented, nor unique to Harris\' office.Asked last month if the recent staff resignations were indicative of a greater trend within her office, Harris declined to weigh in, focusing instead on praising Sanders before adding succinctly, ""Next question.""In November, CNN reported that several people on the vice president\'s staff had started to reach out to contacts to say they\'re looking to leave, according to sources who\'ve gotten calls, while many in the vice president\'s orbit have expressed frustration that Harris has not being adequately prepared or positioned by the White House and instead is being sidelined.This story has been updated with additional background.', 'Carter warns America \'teeters on the brink of a widening abyss\' in stark op-ed ahead of January 6By Shawna Mizelle and Colin McCullough, CNNUpdated 9:45 PM ET, Wed January 5, 2022 Former president Jimmy Carter prior to the game between the Atlanta Falcons and the Cincinnati Bengals at Mercedes-Benz Stadium on September 30, 2018 in Atlanta, Georgia.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN)In the spring of 2006, I received an unexpected call from my friend and client, Barack Obama, who was then a little more than a year into his career in the US Senate.""I just had the strangest conversation with Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer,"" he told me, fresh from a meeting with the US Senate Democratic leaders. ""I didn\'t know why they were calling me over there. Turns out they wanted to tell me I should run for president.""Harry Reid, a longtime US senator from Nevada and former Democratic leader, dies at 82  Reid, then Senate minority leader, argued that, unlike the presumptive frontrunner -- Hillary Clinton -- Obama was untainted by a vote for the unpopular war in Iraq, an albatross the leader feared would sink her and take some of his party\'s Senate candidates down in the undertow. Far from viewing Obama\'s newness to Washington, DC, as an impediment, Reid, who had served there for over 20 years, argued that the young senator\'s freshness would be an asset to a country hungry for change.""They pushed me pretty hard to think about it,"" Obama told me, still absorbing the full meaning of what had just transpired. ""I still think it\'s pretty far-fetched, but it\'s interesting that they felt as strongly as they do."" I can\'t say that Obama would never have come around to the idea of running for president without the quiet encouragement of Reid that spring. But I can say for sure that their conversation made a deep impression on the young senator, who knew that Reid hadn\'t fought his way up through the rough-and-tumble of Nevada politics and the ranks of the US Senate by making careless bets.Read MoreThe fact that the leader would buck the party establishment, of which he was part, by planting the seeds of an insurgency was an unexpected turn that begged serious consideration.As different as they seemed, a tremendous bond grew between the understated Reid -- who died Tuesday at 82 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer -- and the charismatic young president he helped propel forward. Reid\'s improbable rise from hardscrabble beginnings in the tiny brothel town of Searchlight, Nevada, was the stuff of legends, and he saw in Obama someone who had overcome his own hardships -- along with withering racial barriers -- to achieve unimaginable heights.JUST WATCHEDGergen looks back on Harry Reid\'s career in the SenateReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHGergen looks back on Harry Reid\'s career in the Senate 02:29After the election of 2008, Reid, by then Senate majority leader, sat down with President-elect Obama. A prizefighter in his youth, Reid made a point by recalling his days in the ring. ""I wasn\'t the fastest guy. I wasn\'t the strongest. But I sure could take a punch!""And he would take, and throw, many punches for Obama\'s agenda. Along with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Reid\'s persistence helped deliver the Affordable Care Act after an epic battle, an achievement which he said had particular meaning to him because of the privations he had seen uninsured family members and neighbors suffer in his life.""I felt a tremendous pressure to get it done. And having been raised the way that I was with no health care, my mother had no teeth, we didn\'t go to doctors... it was one of the landmark pieces of legislation in the history of this country,"" he told me in 2019. But if Reid, who served as the Democratic leader for 12 years, was a point man for his president, he also was a hard-nosed realist when it came to protecting the members of his caucus from unnecessarily risky votes.He called me in the early summer of 2009 and wanted to talk about a cap-and-trade bill we had passed through the US House of Representatives to reduce the carbon emissions that were accelerating climate change. The bill was controversial in energy-producing states, and the House vote had been a heavy lift. Now we were hoping for a vote in the Senate, which we knew would be even more challenging.""You know we have a lot going on up here this summer, what with the health care bill and a lot of other things we absolutely have to get done,"" Reid said. ""So we\'re not going to get to the climate bill."" He paused. ""Would you tell the President?"" At that moment, the line went dead, which is how every telephone conversation with the leader ended.JUST WATCHEDHarry Reid: I do not regret changing the Senate rulesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHarry Reid: I do not regret changing the Senate rules 03:44""I\'m not much for small talk. The conversation was over; we\'d done our business. There\'s no need to talk anymore,"" he explained to me in 2019 when I asked him about this and his legendary habit of ending calls without saying goodbye.Throughout those years, Reid tangled regularly with Mitch McConnell, who as the Senate Republican leader, led an implacable opposition to Obama, including the brazen decision to block the Senate for the better part of the President\'s final year from taking up the nomination of Merrick Garland to the US Supreme Court.When I last sat down with Reid for ""The Axe Files,"" Reid had plenty to say about that blockade, yet he refrained from making it personal. A proud and pugnacious partisan, he also was a man of the institution. At the end of his life, he was not going to impugn his longtime adversary.  ""I know Mitch McConnell very well, and I\'m not going to disparage him here today,"" he said. ""But I have been somewhat disappointed. I think what he did with the Supreme Court is something that will go down in history as a very dark time in the history of this country.""Reid was a rare person in today\'s politics. A plainspoken man, allergic to flowery rhetoric and performative politics; relentless -- even ruthless -- in pursuit of legislative and electoral victories but animated by time-honored verities and ideals to which he held fast until the end.  And he was palpably proud of his partnership with the 44th president.Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion\'s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookOn the last lap of Obama\'s final campaign in 2012, we made a stop for a rally in Las Vegas.  Reid had requested a minute with Obama to ask him to cut an ad for Mazie Hirono, the Democratic Senate candidate in Hawaii. But after he made the ask, the leader suddenly reached out and hugged the President, a physical display of fellowship and affection that surprised us. Then he turned abruptly and, like a Reid phone call, he was gone without another word.In 2019, I asked him about that moment and his relationship with the President for whom he had made such a difference.""Well, I don\'t hesitate to say on this show, I don\'t care who\'s listening and this is something I don\'t throw around very often, but I love Barack Obama, I really do,"" he told me. ""No one else could do what he did.""Right back at you, Sen. Reid. May you rest in peace. And may your remarkable memory always be a blessing.', 'Former US Sen.

Reid underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer in 2018 and said less than a year later that he was in remission. At the time, he told CNN\'s Dana Bash that he felt ""very good"" and that he was ""doing fine."" But Reid responded to his cancer diagnosis with his usual bluntness, telling The New York Times in 2019: ""As soon as you discover you have something on your pancreas, you\'re dead."" From modest beginnings to the US Senate The beginning of Reid\'s life didn\'t hint at his political future. Born in 1939 in a modest home with no running water, his mother once earned money by doing laundry for local brothels, he wrote in his memoir, ""The Good Fight,"" while his father worked as a hard-rock miner. He attended high school in Henderson, Nevada, often hitchhiking the 45-mile route. A boxer in his youth, Reid later attended Utah State University before moving to Washington, DC, and working his way through law school at George Washington University by working as an officer for the United States Capitol Police.

Harry ReidReid acknowledges the audience during a Nevada Democrats event in Las Vegas in 2019. A year earlier, he underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer.Hide Caption 33 of 33After law school, Reid returned to Nevada and served as lieutenant governor from 1971 to 1975, the youngest person elected to that role in the state. After losing reelection, Reid served as chair of the Nevada Gaming Commission, a powerful position that oversees and regulates the state\'s casino industry. The job made Reid and his family a target of the mob: After he left that post, his wife found a bomb in the family\'s car, Reid wrote in his memoir. Reid\'s political career grew with Nevada. When the state went from one congressional district to two after the 1980 census, Reid ran for a newly created congressional district around Las Vegas in 1982 and won the general election. He was reelected in 1984. He then successfully ran for Nevada\'s open Senate seat in 1986.  He rose through the leadership ranks there, serving as the chamber\'s Democratic whip from 1999 to 2005. From 2005 through his retirement in 2017, he served as his party\'s leader in the Senate, through Democrats\' time in both the minority and the majority. Playing politics  As the chamber\'s Democratic leader, Reid was a polarizing figure. Republicans argued much of the congressional gridlock stemmed from his hard-ball tactics, but Reid often reveled in playing the political bad guy -- even calling then-President George W. Bush a ""loser"" and a ""liar."" (Later, when Donald Trump was in the White House, Reid told CNN\'s Bash that he wished for Bush ""every day."") Reid is often blamed for deepening an era of political polarization with irascible rhetoric about Republicans and the use of controversial Senate procedures that left traditionalists worried that the consensus that once made the chamber special had vanished forever.  He brought those same tactics to electoral politics, too. During Obama\'s reelection bid in 2012, Reid accused Republican nominee Mitt Romney, with no evidence, of not paying his taxes. Asked by CNN in 2015 whether he regretted the attack, Reid said, ""I don\'t regret that at all."" ""Romney didn\'t win, did he?"" Reid asked rhetorically. As much as he irked Republicans, he was often cheered by Democrats for being the last line of defense to Bush and other Republicans. He was a staunch defender of social programs and, reflecting wishes of the large Latino community back home, a proponent of immigration reform.  Reid shepherded the centerpieces of Obama\'s liberal political legacy into law, and he said one of his proudest accomplishments had been encouraging then-Sen. Obama to run for president.  ""I did call him into my office and told him he should take a look at it. And he was stunned because I was the first one that ever suggested that to him,"" Reid told CNN in 2015.  ""When he was reelected, (that was) one of the most moving phone calls I\'ve ever received because he said, you know, \'You\'re the reason I\'m here,\'"" Reid recalled. Obama reiterated that sentiment in the letter he sent to Reid released Tuesday evening. ""Here\'s what I want you to know. You were a great leader in the Senate, and early on you were more generous to me than I had any right to expect,"" Obama wrote.""As different as we are, I think we both saw something of ourselves in each other - a couple of outsiders who had defied the odds and knew how to take a punch and cared about the little guy. And you know what, we made for a pretty good team,"" he added.Former President Bill Clinton also lauded Reid, remembering him as ""one of the most effective Senate leaders our country has ever known.""""We will likely never see another public servant quite like him—in personality, command of strategy and tactics, and assuredness in marching to the beat of his own drum,"" Clinton said in a statement.In the darkest hours of the Great Recession, Reid ushered a nearly $800 billion economic stimulus plan through the Senate despite insurmountable rows with most Republicans, who said it was too expensive and racked up too much debt.  Later, he piloted the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, through the Senate using a controversial budget maneuver known as reconciliation to bypass a Republican filibuster, and he told the GOP to ""stop crying"" about it.  ""Senator Harry Reid was a leader of immense courage and ferocious conviction who worked tirelessly to achieve historic progress for the American people,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who, as the House\'s top Democrat for the last 20 years, worked with Reid across the Capitol. ""Over more than four decades of public service, Senator Reid was guided always by his North Star: to improve the lives of working families like his own,"" she added in a statement reflecting on his death. In modern-day Washington, the former senator\'s impact is perhaps most present in his 2013 change to the Senate rules to prevent filibusters of most executive branch nominations. He told CNN last year that he ""absolutely"" doesn\'t regret changing the rules at the time, saying: ""I have no regret. It was the right thing to do. And by the way, it\'s not the first time the rules have been changed. They\'ve been changed lots of times. It was time to do it again.""  Broad use of the filibuster has soared in recent years in an increasingly polarized Congress. The shift prompted Reid to pen an opinion piece in the New York Times in 2019 calling for an end to the filibuster altogether.  ""During the two decades we served together in the United States Senate, and the eight years we worked together while I served as Vice President, Harry met the marker for what I\'ve always believed is the most important thing by which you can measure a person—their action and their word,"" Biden said in his Tuesday statement.""If Harry said he would do something, he did it. If he gave you his word, you could bank on it. That\'s how he got things done for the good of the country for decades,"" the President added.Despite his blunt political style, Reid inspired fierce respect from many of his longtime aides, as well as fellow lawmakers -- even those across the aisle.  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who was frequently at odds with Reid during their lengthy careers, remembered him as a ""one-of-a-kind"" senator, saying their relationship had transcended political fights.""The nature of Harry\'s and my jobs brought us into frequent and sometimes intense conflict over politics and policy. But I never doubted that Harry was always doing what he earnestly, deeply felt was right for Nevada and our country,"" the Kentucky Republican said. ""He will rightly go down in history as a crucial, pivotal figure in the development and history of his beloved home state.""Reid told CNN earlier this year that he has ""a lot of respect"" for John Boehner, the former Republican House speaker from Ohio with whom he sparred for years, as he reacted to excerpts of Boehner\'s memoir and lambasted the Republican Party\'s more recent ""tribal"" turn.   ""The deal is this. John Boehner and I got a lot done, but we didn\'t mince words,"" he said.  Love and legacy Despite Reid\'s reputation as a hard bargainer with no qualms about scrapping with his opponents, he was also known as a romantic and the most influential person in his life was his wife, Landra. The two met in high school when Reid was 15. Her father was so opposed to the two dating that Reid and his would-be father-in-law got into a fist fight early in their courtship. Reid, who was raised agnostic, told Bash in 2015 that their opposition was that they wanted their daughter to marry someone Jewish. They eloped in 1959 during college, converting to Mormonism a year later. Her parents finally came around on him. ""I am a blessed man to have this 5-foot tall woman with me all these years,"" said Reid.  The former Senate majority leader credited one thing for his political success over the years: Hard work.  ""I didn\'t make it in life because of my athletic prowess. I didn\'t make it because of my good looks. I didn\'t make it because I\'m a genius,"" he said in his farewell address on the Senate floor in 2016. ""I made it because I worked hard.""  Reid\'s most lasting legacy is likely to be felt in Nevada, where the senator not only remade the Western state, but turned it into a Democratic stronghold that last backed a Republican president in 2004.  ""The little boy from Searchlight has been able to be part of a changing state of Nevada,"" he said in his farewell address in 2016. Reid was instrumental in pushing Democrats to make Nevada one of the first nominating contests in the country, a move that focused Democratic attention on Nevada and was a catalyst to its leftward shift. He often pushed Democrats to make Nevada even more important, urging the party, because of the state\'s diversity, to move the state before Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states in the nominating process. He also used his power to lift up the careers of younger politicians, like Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, whom the former Senate majority leader recruited to run for his seat when he was retiring in 2016.""Harry Reid was a champion for Nevada, helping preserve our precious environmental treasures, strengthen our rural communities, and build up our great cities,"" Cortez Masto recalled in a statement on Tuesday. ""The American people are better off because of the leadership of Senator Harry Reid.""In recognition of the impact Reid had on Nevada, the Clark County Board of Commissioners voted earlier this year in favor of renaming McCarran International Airport to Harry Reid International Airport. Reid reflected on his life -- and the role he played in changing Nevada -- when he received a lifetime achievement award from the Nevada Democratic Party in 2019. ""It\'s a long way from Searchlight to Washington,"" he said. ""But I didn\'t get there alone. I got there because of you, Nevadans."" This story has been updated with additional information.

', 'As South Africa mourns Desmond Tutu, so do LGBTQ groups, Palestinians and climate activistsBy Joshua Berlinger, CNNUpdated 10:37 AM ET, Mon December 27, 2021 JUST WATCHEDLook back at the life of Archbishop Desmond Tutu ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLook back at the life of Archbishop Desmond Tutu  03:04 (CNN)On Monday, cathedral bells tolled at midday in Cape Town as South Africa began a week of mourning for the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who died on Sunday. As his country marks Tutu\'s life and death, people around the world are doing the same, including many from groups he supported, from LGBTQ communities to Palestinians and climate justice advocates.While Tutu was best known for helping to end decades of institutionalized segregation and racism in South Africa, and for heading the truth and reconciliation commission that came in its aftermath, he was also celebrated for lending his voice to other injustices and oppression globally.""Anywhere where the humanity of people is undermined, anywhere where people are left in the dust, there we will find our cause,"" Tutu said in a 2013 interview.Table Mountain in Cape Town, South Africa, is lit up in purple on Sunday in memory of Desmond Tutu.LGBTQ advocacyRead MoreThe respect Tutu had garnered as South Africa\'s moral compass made him one of Africa\'s most important LGBTQ allies.Joni Madison, the interim President of the Human Rights Campaign -- a prominent LGBTQ advocacy group -- said Tutu\'s ""powerful allyship will never be forgotten."" ""We are forever grateful,"" Madison tweeted.Tutu was a vocal opponent of gender discrimination and supporter of the LGBTQ community. He was an active participant in the United Nations\' Free & Equal campaign and often compared the struggle of those singled out for their sexual orientation to apartheid. In a 2007 interview with the BBC, he said: ""If God, as they say, is homophobic, I wouldn\'t worship that God."" Years later he added, ""I would refuse to go to a homophobic heaven ... I mean I would much rather go to the other place,"" referring to hell. Archbishop Desmond Tutu, center, at the launch of Free & Equal, a United Nations global public education campaign for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality on July 26, 2013 in Cape Town.Speaking about gender-based discrimination and violence against LGBTQ people, Tutu said: ""I cannot keep quiet when people are penalized for something about which they can do nothing,"" adding ""I oppose such injustice with the same passion that I opposed apartheid.""Tutu\'s own daughter -- Mpho Tutu van Furth, an Anglican minister herself -- was forced to resign her post after she married a woman in 2016.She told the Guardian shortly after her marriage that the situation was ""painful."" ""My father campaigned for women\'s ordination, and so every time I stand at the altar I know that this is part of his legacy,"" Tutu van Furth said. ""It is painful, a very odd pain, to step down, to step back from exercising my priestly ministry.""Same-sex relationships and homosexuality are frowned upon in many of Africa\'s more conservative corners. South Africa is the only country on the continent that has legalized gay marriage, and same-sex relationships are not legal in 32 of Africa\'s 54 countries, according to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association. Senegal and Ghana are both debating bills targeting the gay community. Palestinian rightsTutu was also vocal advocate for the rights of the Palestinian people, and politicians in Gaza and the West Bank mourned the late archbishop as an ally in their struggle.""We will always remember Desmond Tutu as one of the most courageous and principled warriors for human rights and equality in South Africa and Palestine,"" said Husam Zomlot, the head of Palestinian Mission to the UK. Former Palestinian Minister of Higher Education Hanan Ashrawi tweeted that Tutu\'s ""humanity and compassion were equaled only by his courage and principled commitment in our shared struggle for justice and freedom."" Palestine mourns the passing of Desmond Tutu, whose humanity & compassion were equalled only by his courage & principled commitment in our shared struggle for justice & freedom. His support for Palestine was an embrace of love & empathy. I\'m honoured to have had him as a friend.— Hanan Ashrawi (@DrHananAshrawi) December 26, 2021\n\n""His support for Palestine was an embrace of love and empathy,"" said Ashrawi.Tutu tried to use his moral authority to get both Israelis and Palestinians to seek a path of nonviolence. During the 2014 war, when Israel launched an operation to stop the militant group Hamas from firing rockets into Israeli territory, Tutu accused Israel of employing ""disproportionately brutal response"" and called for both sides to abandon violence in favor of dialogue.By the time a stable ceasefire was reached after several weeks, more than 2,200 Gazans had been killed in the fighting. About half of them civilians, including more than 550 children, according to a United Nations report. The UN said 71 Israelis were killed, 66 of whom were soldiers.""We are opposed to the injustice of the illegal occupation of Palestine. We are opposed to the indiscriminate killing in Gaza. We are opposed to the indignity meted out to Palestinians at checkpoints and roadblocks. We are opposed to violence perpetrated by all parties. But we are not opposed to Jews,"" Tutu wrote in Haaretz, one of Israel\'s biggest English-language newspapers, at the time.""We know that when our leaders began to speak to each other, the rationale for the violence that had wracked our society dissipated and disappeared,"" he said. ""We also know the benefits that dialogue between our leaders eventually brought us; when organizations labeled \'terrorist\' were unbanned and their leaders, including Nelson Mandela, were released from imprisonment, banishment and exile.""However, his unique view on the power of truth, absolution and reconciliation sometimes landed him in hot water. His sermon on the importance of forgiveness after visiting the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Israel in 1989  drew the ire of Jewish activists, including fellow Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel. ""For anyone in Jerusalem, at Yad Vashem, to speak about forgiveness would be, in my view, a disturbing lack of sensitivity toward the Jewish victims and their survivors. I hope that was not the intention of Bishop Tutu,"" Wiesel said at the time. Desmond Tutu, center, visits a house in the town of Beit Hanun in the northern Gaza Strip on May 28, 2008.Tutu, over the years, said that he was opposed to oppression and violence on both sides of the conflict. But his frequent comparisons of Israel\'s treatment of Palestinians to that of Black South Africans and his support for boycotts of Israel drew the ire of many Israeli politicians, especially those that were more hawkish on defense issues. ""Tutu, like many in the South Africa struggle against apartheid, had a natural affinity for the Palestinians and a world view that they were similar,"" Arthur Lenk, Israel\'s former ambassador to South Africa, told the Jerusalem Post. ""He (Tutu) wasn\'t a friend of Israel, but that said, he was a man of great achievement, heroism and bravery. And anyone who celebrates democracy knows that he\'s at the top of the list of people who should be honored, even if he didn\'t see our issue the way we would have liked him to.""Climate and environmentTutu was a firm believer in the power of international boycotts, divestment policies and sanctions. He saw the global push to economically punishment and isolate South Africa as crucial factor in ending apartheid. JUST WATCHED2017: Why Desmond Tutu continues to inspireReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH2017: Why Desmond Tutu continues to inspire 02:41Though he retired from public service in 2010, Tutu advocate for the international community and individuals themselves to consider such boycotts to stop the climate crisis in the final years of his life. He lobbied to former President Barack Obama to stop the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which would have carried oil from tar sands in Canada to the United States. In 2014, Tutu traveled to Canada assess the project on his own and hear from its supporters and opponents.Canada\'s former environment and climate minister, Catherine McKenna, called Tutu an ""incredible force -- not only leading the fight against apartheid but also fighting for racial equality, climate justice and LGBTQ+ rights."" Tutu wrote multiple pieces in prominent newspapers across the world calling for action. He asked the international community to put in place an ""apartheid-style boycott to save the planet"" in a 2014 op-ed in the Guardian -- which Greta Thunberg tweeted to acknowledge his death -- and called the climate crisis the ""apartheid of our times"" in the Financial Times in 2019. ""Over the 25 years that climate change has been on the world\'s agenda, global emissions have risen unchecked while real-world impacts have taken hold in earnest,"" Tutu said in a lecture put on by his foundation last year. ""Time is running out.
