"['', '', 'Third House Republican who voted to impeach Trump calls it quitsBy Melanie Zanona, CNNUpdated 1:07 PM ET, Fri January 14, 2022 Rep. John Katko speaks during a House Natural Resources Subcommittee hearing in December 2021. (CNN)Rep. John Katko of New York, one of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Donald Trump, announced Friday he will not seek reelection.In his announcement, Katko cited wanting to be more present with his family as part of the reason for his decision.""That\'s why, after 32 years of public service, I have decided not to seek re-election to Congress, so that I can enjoy my family and life in a fuller and more present way,"" Katko said.Katko is the third House GOP impeachment backer to call it quits, following in the footsteps of Reps. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio. Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan, who also voted to impeach, is undecided if he\'s going to run again. The veteran lawmaker told CNN that he will decide this month as he evaluates how his district lines are being drawn.Trump celebrated Katko\'s decision in a statement Friday, saying, ""Great news, another one bites the dust. Katko, from Upstate New York, is gone!""Read MoreKatko was in line to become the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee next year if Republicans win the majority following the midterms this fall. But he had become a top target on the right, not only for his impeachment vote, but also because he supported a bipartisan infrastructure bill and negotiated a proposal to create a bipartisan commission to probe January 6. Late last year, conservatives started demanding that Katko be kicked off his committees. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a hardcore Trump supporter from Georgia, suggested that would be one of her demands in exchange for supporting House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy for speaker.House GOP\'s impeachment backers vow to stay in the midterm fight against Trump and his alliesIn his retirement announcement, Katko defended his voting record, saying: ""My conscience, principles, and commitment to do what\'s right have guided every decision I\'ve made as a Member of Congress, and they guide my decision today.""Katko\'s retirement now creates an unexpected pickup opportunity for Democrats, though the new maps in New York have yet to be finalized. Katko has represented the Syracuse-based swing district since 2015. Katko has shown an ability to defy expectations in what has traditionally been a Democratic-leaning district; a Democratic challenger who ran against him and lost twice had opted last year not to challenge Katko a third time.McCarthy has also recognized the value of having Katko in that seat. He privately urged Trump not to back a primary challenger to Katko, and also used a joint fundraising committee to help donate to Katko\'s campaign coffers.But McCarthy and Katko\'s relationship had grown increasingly strained over the past year, despite the pair being allies at one point. McCarthy deputized Katko to cut a deal with Democrats on a bipartisan commission to investigate the insurrection, and Katko won a number of key concessions in those negotiations. But after Katko reached a deal, McCarthy decided not to back the proposal, which sources said caught Katko by surprise. That proposal passed the House with the support of 35 Republicans, but was ultimately blocked by the Senate GOP.This story has been updated with additional developments Friday.CNN\'s Manu Raju contributed to this report.', 'Biden to hold press conference Wednesday at the White HouseBy Betsy Klein, CNNUpdated 12:59 PM ET, Fri January 14, 2022 JUST WATCHEDWatch President Biden\'s entire January 6th speechReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWatch President Biden\'s entire January 6th speech 24:34 (CNN)President Joe Biden is set to hold a news conference marking his first year in office next Wednesday, January 19, White House press secretary Jen Psaki announced Friday.""Next Wednesday, the President will hold a formal press conference at 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon,"" Psaki told reporters at the press briefing.Psaki continued, ""Look forward to seeing you there, and the President looks forward to speaking directly to the American people.""Though Biden has fielded questions from the press informally following remarks and during departures and arrivals at the White House, he has not held a formal press conference since he addressed reporters at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, on November 2, 2021.Biden held nine total press conferences, including six solo and three joint press conferences with other world leaders, in his first year in office, according to data tracked by the American Presidency Project at the University of California at Santa Barbara.

Greg Abbott arrives for a news conference in Mission, Texas, on October 6, 2021. Abbott, who\'s up for reelection, has hammered the Biden administration over the arrival of thousands of migrants at the border.  (CNN)As ambitious Republicans plot their return to power in the midterm elections and in statewide races across the country, a familiar face is ready and willing to help them capitalize on President Joe Biden\'s sagging poll numbers on immigration.Stephen Miller, the architect of former President Donald Trump\'s immigration policy, is among a group of policy hawks urging Republican Party officials and candidates to exploit what they describe as Biden\'s glaring vulnerability, after crises on the border. GOP plots onslaught of Biden probes in the run-up to 2024""I\'m very open about the fact that I believe the Republican Party needs to really dig in starting now, and work and put in the work to elevate this issue to the center of our national dialogue,"" Miller told CNN, adding he\'s been in discussions with Republican Party officials and candidates who he has prior relationships with. He\'s among a group of Trump White House aides who will be formally advising the Pennsylvania US Senate campaign of David McCormick, a Republican hedge fund executive, a person familiar with the campaign told CNN.But with or without Miller\'s direct input, immigration is set to vex Democrats. The ebbs and flows of migration patterns are generally out of the control of any sitting US president, but Biden has faced mounds of criticism from both the left and the right. Read MoreMost recently, the White House made an about-face on whether migrant families separated under the Trump administration deserve compensation. Initially Biden said they did, but after intense criticism, his administration walked away from the negotiations, which had reportedly included a figure of up to $450,000 per individual affected by the policy, and now the Justice Department has outlined its arguments against payment in a recent court filing.The administration\'s immigration policy challenges come as Biden\'s approval rating has sagged. A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday finds the President\'s approval rating at 33% approve to 53% disapprove, with another 13% not offering opinions. Other relatively recent surveys have shown him with a somewhat higher approval rating, but similar numbers on disapproval.And in December, a survey found that Biden\'s approval ratings on immigration -- 40% -- stood below his overall approval number at the time.Supporters of President Donald Trump chant ""Latinos for Trump!"" during a campaign rally on October 28, 2020, in Goodyear, Arizona. As a result, Republican strategists expect immigration to play a significant role in primaries this year following months of criticism over the administration\'s handling of the US-Mexico border. ""When it gets to how does it look for the next year, I think you\'ll see it a lot in primary races, and I think you\'ll see it in more conservative districts and if a candidate is underperforming among Republican voters,"" one Republican strategist told CNN. But focusing solely on immigration is unlikely to help sway swing voters, the strategist warned, and will instead be cited as a failure of the Biden administration, among other issues.  In Arizona, where there\'s a key US Senate race, state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who\'s sued the Biden administration over immigration policies, listed border security in a video launching his campaign for the Senate, showcasing a headline about his fight to ""retain Trump immigration rules.""In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott, who\'s up for reelection, has similarly challenged policies in court and hammered the Biden administration over the arrival of thousands of migrants at the US southern border. And it\'s not confined to border states. In Pennsylvania, Republican candidate for governor Lou Barletta jumped on flights transporting migrants to the state -- a routine practice. ""It\'s nothing that Republicans need to do to make it an issue. It\'s become an issue,"" said Dave Carney, a Republican political consultant, referring to border security. Some observers argue that the administration\'s lack of strategy on immigration has contributed to confusion and frustration. That\'s a concern for Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas. Cuellar, who has been critical of the administration\'s approach to the border, told CNN he\'s repeatedly heard from constituents who share similar concerns.""They think Democrats are pretty much more open borders. They feel that they\'re not doing enough,"" Cuellar said. ""The Republicans have certainly jumped on that issue.""A dramatic increase in number of migrants seeking asylum in Arizona overwhelms Border PatrolIt could be a particularly difficult subject for Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, who\'s seen as one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the Senate. The Arizona-Mexico border has recently faced a surge of migrants that\'s overwhelmed resources. Despite a Democratic victory in the state in 2020, Republicans are buoyant that voters have soured on Democratic control and will punish the party at the ballot box in 2022.The Biden administration has held on to some Trump-era policies, including a public health order allowing for the swift expulsion of migrants encountered at the border and, in the wake of a lower court decision, a policy forcing migrants to stay in Mexico until their US immigration court dates. But that hasn\'t shielded Biden from criticism from the right, and has instead fueled frustration on the left. Immigrant advocacy groups repeatedly expressed their disappointment with the administration maintaining Trump-era border policies and expelling thousands of migrants encountered at the border over the last year. ""One side is filling the zone with a narrative and the other side is saying virtually nothing. As a result, many swing voters who found Trump\'s cruelty abhorrent are upset at Biden for what they call minding the store and not having a plan,"" said Frank Sharry, president of America\'s Voice, an immigrant advocacy group.  ""Democratic candidates are going to have to both compete on who has the better solution, who has the best immigration solution, and by pivoting to issues that motivate Democratic voters,"" he added. Anti-immigrant groups see an opportunity to lean into that this year. ""How can the Republican political apparatus not seize on what is the most, the second most, clear obvious political opportunity that Biden has laid open for Republican candidates?"" said Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, citing inflation as the first issue. The group plans to invest millions in issue-based ads this year and roll out additional Spanish-language ads -- a first for the group, Stein said.Arturo Vargas, chief executive officer of NALEO Educational Fund, warned of viewing Hispanics as a single-issue electorate but noted that campaign ads in English and Spanish are generally important to reaching all segments of the electorate. In 2020, Trump, despite his hardline immigration policies, made inroads among voters in Hispanic areas nationwide. The Republican National Committee plans to capitalize on that and ramp up its outreach to Hispanic voters, according to spokesperson Emma Vaughn.""The issue of immigration cannot be synonymous with the Latino issue, which too often happens with candidates and campaigns,"" Vargas said. ""There are certainly segments of the Latino electorate for whom immigration reform is a top priority and they\'ll hold candidates accountable for whether they\'ll get immigration reform.""To that end, Democratic lawmakers have pledged to continue seeking a path for immigration revisions after the Senate parliamentarian rejected multiple attempts to include immigration provisions in the Build Back Better legislation.', 'Takeaways from the landmark sedition indictment against the Oath Keepers and why DOJ acted nowBy Marshall Cohen, CNNUpdated 8:49 AM ET, Fri January 14, 2022 JUST WATCHEDSee the messages Oath Keepers leader sent to followersReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH (16 Videos)See the messages Oath Keepers leader sent to followers\'Shameless\': Avlon reacts to McCarthy\'s press conferenceDOJ files rarely-used \'seditious conspiracy\' charges against January 6 defendants Why the Supreme Court decided against vaccine mandateHear why Sinema is concerned about eliminating filibusterThe case against a 2024 Hillary Clinton candidacy Senator says he\'s \'glad\' Biden went a \'little too far\' in voting rights speechHear how McCarthy\'s words on 1/6 have changed in a year\'Extraordinarily painful to watch\': GOP senator under fire for remarks about Black judicial nomineeEfforts to reform 19th century law could decide who is president in 2024Lindsey Graham picks side in Trump vs. McConnell divideCNN reporter explains what GOP is plotting if they win majority\'It looks bleak, honestly\': Gloria Borger on Biden\'s push to pass voting rights billsFauci calls Republican senator a \'moron\' under his breath during tense hearingReporter explains why McConnell isn\'t talking about TrumpTrump attacks McConnell in new interview (CNN)The Justice Department on Thursday announced the first sedition charges related to the January 6 insurrection, a watershed moment in the year-long investigation. The case revolves around the Oath Keepers, a far-right extremist group, and its leader Stewart Rhodes. Many of the defendants were already facing charges for storming the US Capitol building and deny wrongdoing. But the new indictment raises the stakes significantly and made public new details about their alleged plans for violence.Attorney General Merrick Garland had balked at the earlier efforts to bring the seditious conspiracy charge. But in the months since, people briefed on the matter say FBI investigators and DC federal prosecutors have spent much time building the case, at least in part with the help of cooperators and the benefit of internal communications among the Oath Keepers. Here are the key takeaways:DOJ went there on seditionRead MoreFederal prosecutors have been slammed -- by legal experts, Democratic lawmakers, Donald Trump critics, and media pundits -- for going easy on the rioters. That criticism has now been answered in a big way with the charges of ""seditious conspiracy.""Garland said in a major speech last week that prosecutors would go after the January 6 perpetrators ""at any level... whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy."" Thursday\'s indictment puts some meat on the bones.Oath Keepers leader and 10 others charged with \'seditious conspiracy\' related to US Capitol attackSedition is difficult to prove in court, and an indictment is only the very beginning of a legal case. There are many hoops that prosecutors will need to jump through before they win convictions. But this is a critical first step. It destroys, once and for all, the talking point from those downplaying the events of January 6 that the attack on the Capitol wasn\'t an insurrection because nobody has been charged with sedition.It took a while to reach this point in the investigation. Last March, it seemed like former US Attorney Michael Sherwin, who initially led the investigation, got out ahead of his skis when he said there should be sedition cases. Months passed without anything materializing to back up his assertions. With the new indictment, Sherwin has been vindicated. Extent of preparation for January 6One of the most debated questions about January 6 has been over how much planning there was to invade the Capitol.Thousands of Trump supporters breached Capitol grounds, and a couple thousand got inside the building. But was there a plan? And who knew about the plan?It\'s clear from court filings that for many of the rioters, there was no organized plan. But that\'s not the full story. The sedition case against the Oath Keepers highlights that there were hardened groups of alleged criminals within the mob that essentially planned for war.JUST WATCHEDThe extremist Oath Keepers who planned attack on Capitol ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe extremist Oath Keepers who planned attack on Capitol  04:37Rhodes, the Oath Keepers\' leader, is quoted as telling his supporters that they should prepare for a ""bloody"" operation and that they would need to ""fight"" in a ""war."" One defendant allegedly took an early November trip to Washington to conduct recon for an upcoming ""op."" Communications about the ""bloody"" ""fight"" and ""revolution""  were accompanied by logistical planning, prosecutors alleged, with defendants discussing obtaining and bringing weapons to the Washington area. It could have been worse The indictment provided yet another reminder that January 6 could have been so much worse.Shortly after getting inside the Capitol, one group of Oath Keepers tried to make a coordinated move on the Senate chamber, seemingly as if they were executing a mission. According to the indictment, they ""tried to push their way through"" a line of police, but the officers ""forcibly repelled their advance."" (Other rioters eventually breached the Senate floor and gallery.)Prosecutors added more details of how the Oath Keepers allegedly stockpiled weapons at a nearby hotel in Virginia, just in case they needed to deploy a ""quick reaction force"" into DC. READ: Seditious conspiracy indictment related to US Capitol attackThe charging documents say one defendant, Joshua James, got a message from a friend saying, ""I have friends not far from DC with a lot of weapons and ammo if you get into trouble."" James replied, ""that might be helpful, but we have a s***load of QRF on standby with an arsenal.""Rhodes also amassed weapons and other gear on his way to Washington, DC, before January 6, prosecutors said. He allegedly bought a rifle, a magazine, and other firearms equipment, including sights, mounts, triggers, slings, and an optic plate. Rhodes was on the Capitol grounds on January 6 but hasn\'t been accused of entering the building, though prosecutors have said he ""directed"" his supporters to do so.The plot was bigger than Jan 6Up to this point, federal prosecutors had been accusing conspiracy defendants of aiming to block Congress\' vote to certify the election. But Thursday\'s case ups the ante, widening the conspiracy past January 6. The indictment says the Oath Keepers aimed for more than disruption of Congress. This group, prosecutors say, wanted to stop the transfer of presidential power from Trump to Joe Biden. After the insurrection, they gathered to celebrate, then continued talking.""We aren\'t quitting!! We are reloading!!,"" one of the defendants wrote in a Signal chat.In the week after the riot, Rhodes allegedly spent more than $17,500 on weapons, equipment, and ammunition. One member, according to the filings, said Rhodes should stay ""below the radar,"" while another brought what he called ""all available weapons"" to Rhodes\' home in Texas.Here\'s what \'insurrection,\' \'coup\' and \'sedition\' meanAround Inauguration Day, January 20, Rhodes allegedly told associates to organize local militias to oppose the Biden administration. Another member allegedly said, ""After this... if nothing happens...its war...Civil War 2.0.""""Rhodes and certain co-conspirators ... planned to stop the lawful transfer of presidential power by January 20, 2021, which included multiple ways to deploy force,"" the indictment says. Hunting for the bigger fish The Justice Department spent all of 2021 rounding up nearly two dozen alleged members of the Oath Keepers. They secured the cooperation of a few people charged in the original Oath Keepers conspiracy case -- the one without the sedition charges -- which was a significant breakthrough.Now we know that prosecutors were building a bigger case, and moving up the chain, to the leader of the extremist organization. Rhodes has previously denied any wrongdoing regarding January 6.Booking photo of Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes.From Collin County, TexasThe big question is: Is this the end of the road? Could Rhodes have information that implicates anyone else higher up? It has been widely reported that his organization was providing security for Trump surrogates like Roger Stone and Ali Alexander while they were in DC around January 6. A major criminal case obviously ramps up the pressure on people like Rhodes to cut a deal with prosecutors and become a government witness, if they have a story to tell.CNN\'s Katelyn Polantz, Evan Perez and Tierney Sneed contributed to this report.', '', 'How the Supreme Court rules during a pandemic shows what may happen nextBy Joan Biskupic, CNN legal analyst & Supreme Court biographerUpdated 5:42 AM ET, Fri January 14, 2022 JUST WATCHEDWhy the Supreme Court decided against vaccine mandateReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhy the Supreme Court decided against vaccine mandate 01:29 (CNN)The Supreme Court on Thursday undermined the Biden administration\'s effort to stop the spread of Covid-19 among workers and, equally important, revealed how much conservative justices want the federal government out of American life. Justices on the right-wing expressed concerns of US agencies regulating ""the daily lives and liberties of millions of Americans,"" as Neil Gorsuch put it, and that ""the Executive Branch already touches nearly every aspect of Americans\' lives,"" as Samuel Alito wrote. Day of defeats threatens Biden\'s attempt at second year reset""These cases are not about the efficacy or importance of COVID--19 vaccines,"" Justice Clarence Thomas added in one of the paired controversies. ""They are only about whether (a federal agency) has the statutory authority to force healthcare workers, by coercing their employers, to undergo a medical procedure they do not want and cannot undo."" RELATED: Day of defeats threatens Biden\'s attempt at second year resetTheir views, intensifying in recent years, are likely to result in limits on federal power over public health and safety, labor protections and environmental safeguards. Immediately on the horizon, in cases to be argued in February, are questions about the reach of the Environmental Protection Agency to curtail power plant emissions. Read MoreThe urgency of the current pandemic, with nearly 1 million Americans killed, failed to entice conservatives to pull back. Rather, the cases offered an opportunity -- especially for three justices on the far right -- to demonstrate resolve in this area of the law. At stake are practical questions related to the administration\'s efforts to protect public health and the environment, as well as fundamental separation of powers concerns. The conservative majority led by Chief Justice John Roberts has increasingly restricted regulatory authority, as seen in Thursday\'s decision blocking a vaccine requirement for large employers that could have affected an estimated 80 million workers. But Roberts has not pressed as forcefully as Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch for a wholesale overhaul of federal power. Roberts, in fact, voted separately on Thursday to allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to impose a vaccine mandate on workers at hospitals and other places that receive federal Medicare and Medicaid funding. Supreme Court blocks nationwide vaccine and testing mandate for large businesses, allows health care worker vaccine mandate to take effect Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined Roberts, along with the court\'s three liberal justices, in that decision covering an estimated 10 million health care workers. In dissent were Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch, along with the newest appointee of former President Donald Trump, Amy Coney Barrett. The paired disputes and shifting votes revealed the conservative-liberal power struggle on this nine-member bench. But they also demonstrated that within the dominant right-wing, three justices -- Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch -- wield a more muscular approach against traditional agency authority. Their views could more significantly imperil US regulators, and their inherent expertise, while bestowing more power on the judiciary. To that point, Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, dissenting as the majority rejected the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) vaccine rule, wrote, ""The agency has thoroughly evaluated the risks that the disease poses to workers across all sectors of the economy. ... The agency\'s Standard is informed by a half century of experience and expertise in handling workplace health and safety issues. The Standard also has the virtue of political accountability, for OSHA is responsible to the President, and the President is responsible to -- and can be held to account by -- the American public."" The liberals went on to say, ""And then, there is this Court. Its Members are elected by, and accountable to, no one. And we lack the background, competence, and expertise to assess workplace health and safety issues."" \'Grave danger\' vs. congressional approval The Biden administration had argued that OSHA\'s power to force employers with 100 or more workers to institute a vaccine requirement or weekly Covid-19 testing and masks derived from its statutory authority to protect employees from ""grave danger"" through exposure to a new hazards and harmful agents.  Spurning those arguments, the court declared in its main opinion that OSHA exceeded its statutory role in workplace safety as it addressed broad public health concerns arising from Covid-19. The majority opinion, which was unsigned, narrowly construed OSHA\'s power over ""occupational"" safety. Democrats walk on eggshells around Breyer as GOP plans another blockade for any Biden Supreme Court pickIt described the Biden rule as a ""blunt instrument"" that ""draws no distinctions based on industry or risk of exposure to Covid-19. Thus, most lifeguards and linemen face the same regulations as do medics and meatpackers."" The court\'s emphasis, that the vaccine rules were ""not property tailored to the risks facing different types of workers and workplaces,"" reflected a traditionally conservative interpretation. RELATED: The current Supreme Court\'s partisan moment rivals Bush v. GoreIn contrast, the three conservatives who offered a separate concurring statement, wrote more expansively about the limits of agency power and addressed larger constitutional questions of the separation of powers. They touched on themes embraced by the administration of Trump, who sought to diminish the reach of ""the administrative state"" in his policy agenda and in the selection of judicial candidates. ""If administrative agencies seek to regulate the daily lives and liberties of millions of Americans ... ,"" Gorsuch wrote, joined by Thomas and Alito, ""they must at least be able to trace that power to a clear grant of authority from Congress.""  Gorusch observed that Congress may sometimes be ""tempted to delegate power to agencies"" to avoid being held accountable for unpopular policies. But he added, ""If Congress could hand off all its legislative powers to unelected agency officials, it would dash the whole scheme of our Constitution and enable intrusions into the private lives and freedom of Americans by bare edict rather than only with the consent of their elected representatives."" Versions of the debate over Congress\' ability to delegate power to agencies has played out past cases, with liberals often emphasizing that Congress relies on agencies to implement laws in today\'s increasingly complex times. The current Supreme Court\'s partisan moment rivals Bush v. GoreOn Thursday, however, the three liberals chose to home in on the immediate cost to the country from the OSHA ruling. ""In the face of a still-raging pandemic,"" Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan wrote in a joint statement, ""this Court tells the agency charged with protecting worker safety that it may not do so in all the workplaces needed. As disease and death continue to mount, this Court tells the agency that it cannot respond in the most effective way possible ... It undercuts the capacity of the responsible federal officials, acting well within the scope of their authority, to protect American workers from grave danger.""

Sign up here.Hong Kong (CNN Business)For many companies, doing business in China is getting trickier by the day. But Western banks and asset managers are more than willing to up their bets on the world\'s second biggest economy, convinced that the opportunities remain too good to pass up.Major banks in recent weeks have inked deals to expand their footprint in China — or are otherwise attempting to take greater control of their businesses there — after years of being forced to enter the market via joint ventures. That\'s despite fraught geopolitics, a slowing economy and an increasingly hostile environment for private business. Late last month, HSBC (HBCYF) received approval from Chinese regulators to take full control of its life insurance joint venture, which was created in 2009 in equal partnership with a Chinese company under rules that were rolled back in 2020. The bank said the move underscored its ""commitment to expanding business in China.""The British banking giant is also seeking a greater stake in HSBC Qianhai, its joint securities venture in China, according to Reuters, which cited an anonymous source. HSBC declined to comment to CNN Business. HSBC (HBCYF) isn\'t the only one. Wall Street A-listers such as BlackRock, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are already a few steps down that road. And the state-owned China Securities Journal reported Wednesday that Deutsche Bank (DB) wants to establish its own wealth management joint venture in the country. The German bank declined to comment.Goldman Sachs looks forward to a \'new chapter\' in ChinaRead More""The sheer size of China\'s virtually untapped equity and bond market is irresistible to the world\'s large financial institutions, especially since Beijing is finally allowing them to operate wholly owned mutual funds,"" said Alex Capri, a research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation.China is the world\'s second biggest market for stocks and bonds. But it\'s largely untapped by foreign investors: International holdings account for about 5% of the $14 trillion stock market, and less than 4% of the $17 trillion onshore bond market, according to stock exchange and central bank data.That started to change last year, after BlackRock (BLK) — the world\'s largest asset manager — in June became the first global firm to gain approval for a wholly owned Chinese mutual fund business. Two months later, BlackRock launched its first mutual fund in the country, and quickly raised $1 billion from more than 111,000 investors.Then, in August, JP Morgan (JPM) became the first US bank to gain full ownership of its securities unit. CEO Jamie Dimon said back then that China represents ""one of the largest opportunities in the world"" for the firm. In October, Goldman Sachs (GS), received the green light to fully take over its securities venture. And Morgan Stanley (MSPRE) followed suit with a victory of its own in December, when its Chinese partner said the American bank planned to boost its stake in a brokerage venture to 94%.More are coming. Earlier this week, China\'s securities regulator said it accepted an application from BNP Paribas (BNPQF) to establish a securities firm, bringing the company a step closer to broadening its presence in the country.""China represents a significant growth opportunity for global financial service companies,"" said Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer for KraneShares, an asset management firm focused on China stocks and bonds.""Developed markets such as the United States and Europe are highly competitive and mature which have led to fee compression and diminishing opportunities,"" he added. But ""China\'s markets are relatively young in comparison.""Expansion despite uncertaintyThe significant inroads for these banks are coming about two decades after China joined the World Trade Organization and promised to open up its financial sector.While progress was slow for a while, the country in 2019 announced that it would entirely remove foreign ownership limits for financial firms the following year, shortly after Chinese President Xi Jinping and former US President Donald Trump agreed to restart trade talks.The enthusiasm from global banks and asset managers also comes with risks, as there is growing uncertainty about China\'s political and regulatory climate — as well as Beijing\'s rising tensions with other countries.China\'s \'revolution\' cost investors $3 trillion. So why aren\'t they running scared?In late 2020, Beijing launched an unprecedented regulatory squeeze on private enterprise, worried that such firms had become too powerful. The ensuing crackdown has extended to major Chinese financial players like Ant Group, which was forced to overhaul its business and hew to strict regulations governing bank operations.""There is a sense, broadly, that Xi may moderate some of his more aggressive rhetoric after this year\'s 20th Party Congress, having assured his political position,"" said Craig Singleton, an adjunct China fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, referring to the widespread expectation that Xi will use an important political gathering to cement a historic third term in office. ""The biggest risk, however, is that he does the opposite.""A number of Western businesses have been swept up in controversy in China as geopolitical tensions worsen, especially over allegations of human rights violations in the country\'s western region of Xinjiang. In recent weeks, Walmart (WMT) and Intel (INTC) met public backlash in China over allegations that they were trying to avoid importing products sourced from Xinjiang. And last year, H&M, Nike (NKE) Adidas (ADDDF) and other Western retailers were threatened with a boycott in China because of the stand they had taken against the alleged use of forced labor to produce cotton in Xinjiang.Pressure at homeWestern companies are also facing pressures at home. Billionaire investor George Soros called BlackRock (BLK)\'s China investment a ""tragic mistake"" that could lose money for its clients and imperil US national security. Some American politicians also called on Wall Street to stop ""enabling Communist China"" and take a tougher stance against Beijing.The squeeze has continued in recent weeks. Last month, US President Joe Biden signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, a law that bans imports from Xinjiang over concerns about forced labor. It sent a clear message that his administration and Congress are looking to ratchet up the pressure on Beijing.Doing business in China is difficult. A clash over human rights is making it harderChina\'s decision to let more foreign firms into the country is ""aimed at shoring up collateral damage in the international community,"" according to Capri, who added that allowing Western companies to take larger stakes in China also gives Beijing ""leverage"" over Washington and Brussels.""This will increase tensions between the big financial firms in the US and Europe, and their home governments,"" he said.The moneymaking potential in China seems to outweigh any political headaches, though.""While China is facing huge economic headwinds, the country has defied bearish predictions in the past,"" Singleton said, adding that Western banks have continued to generate billions of dollars in revenue from China, even with the recent regulatory crackdown.""In other words, Western banks are playing the long game under the guise of portfolio diversification,"" he added.China\'s motiveAnd even as Beijing tightens its grip over parts of its economy, there are reasons why the country is eager to open its financial industry to foreign investors.The government wants to utilize global expertise as it builds a strong and diverse financial service industry, which it needs to manage its looming demographic crisis. A rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce have increased the burden on the country\'s inadequate pension system, and put tremendous pressure on the government to provide enough financial resources for the elderly.Time is running out for China to prepare its economy for a \'great demographic unknown\'China\'s strict adherence to its ""zero Covid"" strategy and slow, self-isolation from much of the world hasn\'t been enough to throw the country off course, either. Last year, Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, repeatedly talked about the importance of opening up the financial service industry and drawing on global capital and financial expertise.""One of the Chinese Communist Party\'s key attributes has been its adaptability and its pragmatism,"" Singleton said. He added that China understands it needs to maintain access to foreign markets, technology and capital, necessitating those continued partnerships with Western firms.""In other words, the CCP must integrate to survive, which means that it cannot completely eschew existing global norms or systems even as it tries to alter them to suit Beijing\'s needs,"" Singleton said.', ""Biden and Democrats run up against relentless conservative powerAnalysis by Stephen Collinson, CNNUpdated 12:37 AM ET, Fri January 14, 2022 JUST WATCHEDWhy the Supreme Court decided against vaccine mandateReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH (16 Videos)Why the Supreme Court decided against vaccine mandate'Shameless': Avlon reacts to McCarthy's press conferenceSee the messages Oath Keepers leader sent to followersDOJ files rarely-used 'seditious conspiracy' charges against January 6 defendants Hear why Sinema is concerned about eliminating filibusterThe case against a 2024 Hillary Clinton candidacy Senator says he's 'glad' Biden went a 'little too far' in voting rights speechHear how McCarthy's words on 1/6 have changed in a year'Extraordinarily painful to watch': GOP senator under fire for remarks about Black judicial nomineeEfforts to reform 19th century law could decide who is president in 2024Lindsey Graham picks side in Trump vs. McConnell divideCNN reporter explains what GOP is plotting if they win majority'It looks bleak, honestly': Gloria Borger on Biden's push to pass voting rights billsFauci calls Republican senator a 'moron' under his breath during tense hearingReporter explains why McConnell isn't talking about TrumpTrump attacks McConnell in new interview (CNN)Democrats control Washington but President Joe Biden is staring at a wall of conservative power, accrued over years and wielded with a ruthlessness and zeal for rule-breaking that his own party has rarely matched. The President's struggles to implement his strategy to protect US democracy and reshape the economy to help working Americans are hampered by divisions in his own party. But a wider battle is playing out -- a generational struggle between conservatism and liberal activism that Biden appears to be losing, despite some early legislative successes, as the right's hold on critical institutions of the US political system tightens.On Thursday, the new conservative Supreme Court majority, fresh from weakening the constitutional right to an abortion, dealt another devastating blow to Biden, striking down his Covid-19 vaccine and testing requirement mandates for big businesses.The decision completed a desperate day for the President after two Democratic senators rebuked his call to change Senate rules in order to pass voting rights legislation. The pair, Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, were at the White House for last-ditch talks with Biden on Thursday night. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer later announced the Senate would take up the voting rights legislation on Tuesday, citing Covid-19 and an impending winter storm, which means the chamber will miss his self-imposed deadline of voting by the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday on Monday.Day of defeats threatens Biden's attempt at second year resetBut unless those two moderates change their minds, Democrats will lose a chance to halt the other big current conservative power play -- a nationwide effort by GOP-run states to make it harder to cast ballots and easier to steal elections, which is rooted in ex-President Donald Trump's voter fraud lies. A parallel effort to restore portions of the Voting Rights Act protections to racial minorities, gutted over the last decade or so by the Supreme Court, will also likely founder in another right-wing victory over democratic values.Read MoreThe latest demonstration of the extraordinary power the 6-3 conservative majority on the court could wield over Democratic presidents for years took place with Republicans already laying plans to eviscerate Biden's White House next year.Certain they will capture the House at least in November's midterm elections, some GOP lawmakers are raising the possibility of impeaching Biden, and planning withering investigations against top administration officials like Dr. Anthony Fauci. The President's son, Hunter Biden, could find himself called to testify before Congress, in what would be an agonizing moment for his father and evidence the GOP would use its possible majorities as an unfiltered tool of revenge for Trump.Meanwhile, the Republican who wants to be the next speaker, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, offered his latest example on Thursday of the absurd political amnesia he is effecting to reinvent history and to cover up his criticisms of Trump over the January 6 insurrection, which he had delivered on the House floor a year ago on Thursday. McCarthy's sycophancy reflected the hold over the party of the twice-impeached ex-President, in the House especially, which could make Biden's political plight intolerable next year. And Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's on-air humiliation at the hands of Fox demagogue Tucker Carlson -- who seized on his comments that January 6 was a terrorist attack -- showed the extent to which the extremist propaganda media machine behind Trump and his authoritarianism has the power to forcibly radicalize Republicans who want a future in the party. In another sign of the right's readiness to use its power to further rupture the traditions of democracy, the Republican Party signaled Thursday that it would force presidential candidates to refuse to debate under the auspices of the Commission on Presidential Debates without major revisions. In 2020, the Trump campaign released a list of potential debate moderators that included several who have since amplified his election fraud lies. There was a mini-revolt among GOP senators this week in support of Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, who had committed the cardinal sin of pointing out the truth that Biden actually won the 2020 election. But Trump apologist and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham warned his longtime friend, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, that he must find a way to work with the ex-President. It's no secret the Kentucky Republican dislikes Trump, though he tolerated -- and sometimes enabled -- him between 2017 and 2021 to advance his own conservative goals.Conservative Supreme Court checks Biden's pandemic plans The Supreme Court's blocking of vaccine and testing requirements at large businesses struck at the heart of Biden's strategy for finally ending the pandemic as the highly infectious Omicron variant surges. More broadly, it devastates his attempt to use the powers of the federal government to combat the worst public health crisis in 100 years. The decision could also offer an opening for other conservative challenges against government authority on which the court might look favorably. In practice, the logic of epidemics also means the decision will slow attempts to stop the spread of the virus and cause more sickness and death.The question of the power of the relative branches of the US government is as old as the republic itself. The court essentially found that Congress hadn't given the Occupational Safety and Health Administration the authority to regulate public health in such a sweeping manner. White Houses often face court rebukes on executive power. Yet the case cannot be divorced from its political context. It was brought by Republican-run states that have spent the past year seeking to disable Biden's attempt to fight the virus. Multiple possible presidential hopefuls, including Govs. Ron DeSantis of Florida and Greg Abbott of Texas, have led the battle, clearly with their own political futures in mind. Nation's top trade groups hail SCOTUS ruling after filing emergency appeals against Biden's vaccine mandateThe decision on mandates was also handed down by the most politicized Supreme Court in modern memory. The conservative majority is the project of a decades-long ideological quest on the right. There's nothing un-American about using elections and democratic majorities to change the balance of the court. But the final leap to that goal showed the kind of relentless and even illegitimate application of power and indifference to the principles of democracy with which Republicans have become synonymous. McConnell, for instance, has spent the week warning that Democrats will destroy the Senate if they change its rules to bypass the filibuster in order to enact voting rights bills by a simple majority. Yet he did much the same in a previous spell as majority leader, pushing through rules changes to allow Supreme Court justices to be confirmed on a majority vote and to bypass a Democratic filibuster. (Republicans followed similar changes to lower judicial confirmations made by former Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid, another hard-nosed power player, who died last month). But McConnell's move undoubtedly changed the Senate and escalated its partisan standoff. Republican hypocrisy is also glaring since McConnell built the conservative majority on the top bench by inventing a Senate principle to justify his refusal to confirm then-President Barack Obama's pick, Merrick Garland, during the Democrat's final year in office. He said the American people should decide who should fill the vacancy during an election. His obstruction paved the way for Trump to pick Justice Neil Gorsuch for the court after he took office. Then, days before the general election in 2020, McConnell ignored his own principle to seat Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a bulwark of the new conservative majority.Republicans are more ruthless than Democrats McConnell's moves might be ruthless and against the spirit of democracy. But so far, Democratic leaders haven't come close to showing the same merciless capacity to maximize their power in order to enshrine long-held goals. In fact, they can't even get their own side on board. Both the voting rights push and Biden's massive climate change and social spending bill have been thwarted by the two moderates -- Sinema and Manchin. Before visiting the White House, both senators indicated Thursday that they will not budge on the filibuster, despite Biden's warning this week that those who stand in the way of protecting democracy against a GOP onslaught are akin to segregationists. In a stunning show of defiance, Sinema took to the Senate floor Thursday to explain herself, just before Biden -- a President of her own party -- arrived on Capitol Hill to make his case.Manchin has provoked fury among Democrats because in a 50-50 Senate they cannot move major legislation without his vote. But his position can also be partially explained by the strength of conservatism. If it weren't for the West Virginian, the party wouldn't have a Senate majority since it fell short of its targets in congressional elections in 2020, with candidates who ran behind Biden in their races. And but for Manchin's 2018 victory in a state that Trump had won overwhelmingly two years earlier and has again since, they'd be in even more trouble. Manchin hasn't said whether he will seek reelection. But clearly, the West Virginian's political choices now are being conditioned by the possibility he may have to run in 2024 in a state that rejected the Biden presidency -- and possibly with Trump heading the Republican ticket.A glimpse of a grim political future The difficulties that the Biden administration encountered in subverting Republican power, despite controlling Congress and the White House, are only a tepid preview of what life could be like after the midterm elections.If Republicans win the House and the Senate in November, Biden will be isolated in the White House, and under siege from a constant churn of investigations and attacks by Republican majorities. All White Houses should expect congressional scrutiny. But top GOP leaders are not even hiding their intention to scorch the political earth for a possible Trump presidential campaign in 2024. CNN's Melanie Zanona and Manu Raju reported Thursday that the GOP is plotting a torrent of investigations. Republicans also appear determined to hold hearings to legitimize Trump's lies about election fraud and to whitewash the truth about the Capitol insurrection he incited.One of the key questions for a future Republican majority would be whether pro-Trump extremists would be so radical that they would give Biden a foil and Democrats a chance to run against rampant extremism in 2024. History suggests overreaching is likely. But in the longer term, Republicans may have such a grip on the mechanics of electoral power that Democrats might find it difficult to exploit such transgressions. And the conservative cast of the Supreme Court ensures that future Democratic majorities and White Houses will find wielding power effectively a constant battle."", '', 'Early warning systems first suggested North Korean missile could hit US, causing temporary scrambleBy Katie Bo Lillis, Barbara Starr and Oren Liebermann, CNNUpdated 10:58 PM ET, Thu January 13, 2022 JUST WATCHEDExplained: How much damage can North Korea\'s weapons do?\ufeffReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHExplained: How much damage can North Korea\'s weapons do?\ufeff 02:22 (CNN)In the minutes after North Korea launched a ballistic missile around 7:30 a.m. local time on Tuesday, the US command responsible for protecting the American homeland from airborne threats raced to determine whether the missile might be capable of striking the United States -- and for a moment, took steps as if it was. It was ""ugly,"" one US lawmaker briefed on the launch said. Defense officials ""didn\'t have a good feel for its capabilities"" right away, this person added. Initial telemetry readings -- which can be inaccurate and are often discarded as more data becomes available -- suggested that the missile could pose a threat as far away as the Aleutian Islands off Alaska or the California coast, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.  Within minutes, US Northern Command and the Northern American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) dismissed those initial readings and assessed that the missile posed no direct threat to the mainland of the United States. The test weapon -- which sources say was a less maneuverable version of a hypersonic glide vehicle designed to evade missile defenses -- splashed down harmlessly in the sea between China and Japan, thousands of miles away from threatening America.  But in those few moments of uncertainty, the situation escalated quickly enough that the Federal Aviation Administration, which is part of a routine interagency discussion whenever there is a missile launch of this kind, grounded some planes on the West Coast around 2:30 p.m. PST on Monday for about 15 minutes.Read MoreThe grounding forced air traffic controllers to hold some aircraft on the ground, while briefly diverting others in the air, according to air traffic control recordings, but controllers were at a loss when asked to explain to pilots what had caused the grounding. Some controllers erroneously referred to it as a national ground stop, something which hasn\'t been seen since 9/11.The question, now, is what sparked that initial burst of urgency -- and perhaps, why the FAA reacted the way that it did. ""What we\'re seeing here is just the normal process of coordination and communication out of which early on some decisions were made that probably didn\'t need to get made,"" Defense Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Thursday afternoon. NORAD insists that it was the FAA\'s call to issue the ground stop and that it did not issue a warning or alert as a result of the North Korean missile launch.""As a matter of precaution, the FAA temporarily paused departures at some airports along the West Coast,"" the FAA said in a statement on Tuesday. ""The FAA regularly takes precautionary measures. We are reviewing the process around this ground stop as we do after all such events.""The FAA did not respond to CNN\'s multiple requests for comment on Thursday.A US official said the ground stop was not communicated through the FAA\'s Air Traffic Control System Command Center, based in Warrenton, Virginia, and instead went straight to regional centers on the West Coast. The launch on Tuesday was the second such launch by North Korea within the space of a week. But the first, last Thursday, was far less sophisticated, South Korean officials have said. US officials are still conducting their assessment of the most recent test, but analysts who closely track North Korea\'s weapons development programs have identified the missile used on Tuesday as what is known as a ""maneuverable reentry vehicle"" -- still a hypersonic glide vehicle that can alter course after reentering the atmosphere but that has a limited range and maneuverability compared to more advanced systems. ""It\'s basically falling,"" said Jeffrey Lewis, a weapons expert and professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies. ""It\'s falling with style.""Lewis said it\'s not unusual for detection systems such as radar or infra-red satellites to struggle to determine a missile\'s trajectory in the first moments after a launch. ""If it\'s a regular old ballistic missile, they can usually calculate that pretty well, but you have to wait for the engine to stop firing,"" he said. ""So that\'s why you sometimes see mistakes, because you\'re trying to calculate it before the engine stops firing, and if you\'re at a funny angle, you might be able to see that it\'s going up but not what direction.""In any case, there is no question that the launch violated UN Security Council resolutions that prohibit North Korea from any ballistic missile activity. And arms control experts have continued to raise alarms that Pyongyang\'s weapons development program continues to pose a long-term threat to the United States and its allies. US officials familiar with North Korea\'s weapons development programs say Pyongyang\'s efforts to develop hypersonic missiles is not a surprise -- North Korea has telegraphed its intent publicly -- even if some of the specific capabilities demonstrated by the missile launched on Tuesday were surprising. Those sources declined to specify what capabilities were unknown. In January of last year, North Korea stated publicly that it had ""finished research into developing warheads of different combat missions including the hypersonic gliding flight warheads for new-type ballistic rockets and was making preparations for their test manufacture.""Still, after years of high-profile diplomatic exchanges between former President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the Biden administration has so far taken a relatively low-key approach to North Korea even as it has continued to condemn testing by Pyongyang.CNN\'s Natasha Bertrand and Pete Muntean contributed to this report.', '', 'RNC threatens to prohibit future GOP presidential nominees from participating in official general election debates By Dan Merica, CNNUpdated 8:50 PM ET, Thu January 13, 2022 Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden and President Donald Trump take part in the first presidential debate at Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, on September 29, 2020. (CNN)The Republican National Committee said Thursday in a letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates that it is prepared to ""prohibit future Republican nominees from participating in CPD-sponsored debates"" unless the commission makes a number of significant changes to its procedure.The letter, which was first reported by The New York Times, was signed by Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel. It was sent to commission co-chairs Frank J. Fahrenkopf and Kenneth Wollack, is the latest in a back-and-forth between the two groups over Republican accusations that the commission is biased.CNN was first to report in June that McDaniel, in another letter to the commission, threatened to advise any future Republican nominee against participating in general election presidential debates unless significant changes are made by the commission.The latest letter, which was sent on Thursday, escalates those threats and outlines actions the RNC plans to take. ""So long as the C.P.D. appears intent on stonewalling the meaningful reforms necessary to restore its credibility with the Republican Party as a fair and nonpartisan actor, the R.N.C. will take every step to ensure that future Republican presidential nominees are given that opportunity elsewhere,"" the RNC chair wrote.Read MoreIf changes are not made, she added, the committee will ""initiate the process of amending the Rules of the Republican Party at our upcoming Winter Meeting to prohibit future Republican nominees from participating in CPD-sponsored debates.""McDaniel has also been clearly unhappy with the committee\'s interactions with the commission, arguing in the letter that the way it responded to Republican concerns was an attempt to ""delay any reform until it is too late to matter for the 2024 election.""The Republican National Committee\'s focus on this is yet another example of Republicans relitigating something that was a top concern for former President Donald Trump.The commission, once a largely anonymous organization that has organized and hosted presidential and vice presidential general election debates since 1988, drew considerable ire from Trump during the 2020 campaign, with he and his campaign aides often railing about the selected moderators, the commission\'s decision to hold the second debate virtually during the coronavirus pandemic and the choice to mute each candidate\'s mic during the final debate after the first contest included considerable interruptions from the then-President.The commission eventually canceled the second debate after Trump declined to attend a virtual debate despite concerns over his Covid-19 diagnosis.In an unsigned statement from the Commission on Presidential Debates, the commission said it ""deals directly with candidates for President and Vice President who qualify for participation in the CPD\'s general election debates.""""The CPD\'s plans for 2024 will be based on fairness, neutrality and a firm commitment to help the American public learn about the candidates and the issues,"" the statement reads.The RNC has advocated for a number of changes to the commission, including adopting term limits for its board and prohibiting members from making public comments about any candidates. McDaniel, in an echo of Trump\'s concerns, has also pushed for more influence on which journalists moderate general election debates, asking the commission for a ""transparent criteria for selecting debate moderators that would disqualify individuals from consideration who have apparent conflicts of interest due to personal, professional, or partisan factors.""Moderators were a central issue for Republicans in 2020 -- especially the selection of C-SPAN\'s Steve Scully to moderate what would have been the second contest.The Trump campaign attacked Scully for working for Biden roughly four decades earlier, leading the journalist to accidentally publicly reach out on Twitter to Anthony Scaramucci, Trump\'s short-lived White House communications director. When the outreach frustrated Republicans, Scully said he had been hacked, something he later admitted was not true. C-SPAN then placed Scully on ""administrative leave"" for lying.McDaniel has long signaled that advising candidates not to participate in CPD-backed debates would be her next move.In a statement to CNN in 2021, McDaniel said the ""Republican Party needs assurances that the CPD will make meaningful reforms to the debate process by working with stakeholders to restore the faith and legitimacy it has lost.""""If not, as RNC Chairman, I will have no choice but to advise future Republican candidates against participating in CPD-hosted debates,"" she added.Jaime Harrison, chair of the Democratic National Committee, slammed his Republican counterpart on Thursday, arguing the back-and-forth shows the GOP committee ""would rather hide their ideas and candidates from voters.""""Regardless of the RNC\'s tantrum, voters can count on hearing from President Biden and Vice President Harris who are proud of their records,"" Harrison said.This story has been updated with additional information about the Republican National Committee\'s letter.', '', 'Day of defeats threatens Biden\'s attempt at second year resetBy Kevin Liptak, CNNUpdated 7:04 PM ET, Thu January 13, 2022 JUST WATCHEDHear why Sinema is concerned about eliminating filibusterReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHear why Sinema is concerned about eliminating filibuster 03:58 (CNN)By the time President Joe Biden was climbing into his limousine on Capitol Hill, his Thursday was already going poorly.An hour before he\'d arrived to meet Senate Democrats, Arizona centrist Sen. Kyrsten Sinema declared on the Senate floor she couldn\'t support any changes to filibuster rules that would be required to pass new voter protection laws. It was less-than-welcome news to the White House, which learned of Sinema\'s plans earlier in the day as aides were preparing for Biden\'s visit.The President was met with a standing ovation among members of his party when he arrived for their meeting in the Kennedy Caucus Room. But when he emerged again 70 minutes later, the President\'s fury at the impasse was obvious.""State and legislative bodies continue to change the law not as to who can vote, but who gets to count the vote. Count the vote. Count the vote,"" Biden inveighed, his voice rising to a shout and echoing in the roof of Russell Rotunda, before walking briskly to his car.As his motorcade was making the short return trip to the White House, another blow arrived, this time from the Supreme Court. Read MoreThe conservative majority blocked his attempt to compel businesses to require their workers be vaccinated, an outcome that aides had been bracing for after the President reluctantly issued the mandate order last fall. Biden was informed of the decision as he returned inside the Oval Office.Setbacks at the hands of Congress or the courts are part of life for any president, as Biden likely remembers from his eight years in the Obama White House. But the string of disappointments within a couple of hours on Thursday was stark -- and will also likely sting given Biden\'s long history with both institutions. Paired with his stalled domestic agenda, a volatile crisis on the Russia-Ukraine border and softening approval ratings, Thursday\'s developments only aggravated the impression of a President faltering as he enters his second year in office.The White House views the situation differently. Aides point to a vaccination campaign that started last year, record job growth, rebuilt foreign alliances and two large pieces of legislation -- a Covid-19 relief package passed in March and the bipartisan infrastructure bill approved in November -- as evidence of a successful presidency so far. And they frame the current setbacks as signs Biden is willing to attempt the difficult rather than settle for the easy.""Having worked in a White House before, you do hard things in White Houses. You have every challenge laid at your feet, whether it\'s global or domestically,"" press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday after a day of difficulties. ""We could certainly propose legislation to see if people support bunny rabbits and ice cream, but that wouldn\'t be very rewarding to the American people. So, the President\'s view is we\'re going to keep pushing for hard things and we\'re going to keep pushing the boulders up the hill to get it done.""The boulder-pushing was continuing Thursday evening at the White House, where Biden met with Sinema and her fellow centrist, Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. The trio planned to discuss voting rights, though each senators\' definitive statements opposing changes to the filibuster made for an unclear path forward.Still, the hopeful approach -- which Biden has also adopted, declaring himself a ""congenital optimist"" -- doesn\'t mask mounting frustration at the state of the President\'s agenda. Government figures this week showing inflation still at a near-40-year high led to another round of questions about the President\'s economic ambitions. And talks with Russia meant to defuse the crisis with Ukraine ended without much hope Vladimir Putin intends to deescalate.Biden\'s frustrations laid bareAhead of a major speech in Atlanta this week on voting rights, Biden faced anger from activists who boycotted the address and said they wanted to see more concrete plans to get something done. Even some who attended the speech said afterward they wanted to see the President step up his efforts.""While President Biden delivered a stirring speech today, it\'s time for this administration to match their words with actions, and for Congress to do their job,"" NAACP President Derrick Johnson wrote in a statement. ""Voting rights should not simply be a priority — it must be THE priority.""On Covid, some of Biden\'s top former advisers went public last week with a plea for him to change course on the pandemic, saying it was time to adopt a strategy geared more toward a ""new normal"" of living with coronavirus permanently. And more than 50 Democrats wrote the White House this week encouraging a more robust testing strategy.Biden\'s own frustration at both matters has become plain. He has vented in public that a stubbornly large percentage of Americans refuse to be vaccinated, prolonging the pandemic. And on Thursday, he flashed anger at the prospect of fellow Democrats stymieing attempts to pass bills bolstering voting rights, which he has said is the single most important issue currently facing the nation.""As long as I have a breath in me, as long as I\'m in the White House, as long as I\'m engaged at all, I\'m going to be fighting to change the way these legislatures have been moving,"" he declared.Behind the scenes, Biden has voiced agitation that some of the problems he is currently facing can\'t seem to be resolved. Along with reforms to voting laws, Biden had envisioned a major expansion of the social safety net and billions in new spending on climate change, all made impossible not only because Republicans universally oppose them but also because two Democrats are holding out.He\'d pictured a country on the road to healing after the divisions exacerbated by his predecessor, whose unyielding sway over the Republican Party and lie about Biden\'s electoral history has persisted beyond Biden\'s expectations.And he had once hoped this would be the year the country was returning to normal after nearly two years of pandemic-dampened life, but the current surge caused by the Omicron variant caught the White House off guard, leading Biden to say publicly he wished he\'d thought earlier of ordering more tests.Court dismantles the centerpiece of Biden\'s vaccination pushThe Supreme Court\'s decision Thursday was not unexpected among Biden\'s team, who\'d been preparing for the outcome. But it did exacerbate an ongoing debate among his team at how aggressively to pursue vaccine mandates as a strategy for ending the pandemic. When Biden turned to the new rules last year, it came after months of holding off for fear the mandates could further alienate vaccine resisters.""The Court has ruled that my administration cannot use the authority granted to it by Congress to require this measure, but that does not stop me from using my voice as President to advocate for employers to do the right thing to protect Americans\' health and economy,"" Biden said in a statement afterward.Psaki demurred when asked Thursday whether Biden was considering any changes to overcome the current challenges, like a shift in his legislative strategy or a shuffle of his West Wing leadership.""Our effort is to do hard things, try hard things, and keep at it. We just don\'t view it through the same prism,"" she said.Entering his second year, Biden hopes to regain the initiative by drawing sharper contrasts with Republicans and resetting expectations that even some of his allies believe were oversized when he entered office.Beginning at last week\'s anniversary of the January 6 insurrection, he has adopted a sharper tone to describe Republicans who have helped former President Donald Trump cultivate the lie that the 2020 presidential election was marred by fraud. And on Thursday, before traveling to Capitol Hill, Biden made a ""special appeal"" to media outlets and social media platforms to take action to prevent bad information about the pandemic from spreading.""Please deal with the misinformation and disinformation that\'s on your shows. It has to stop,"" he said.The approach has not been universally welcomed, even among Democrats.

Follow him on Twitter @julianzelizer. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN)President Joe Biden is struggling politically. Recent polls have shown that his approval ratings continue to fall. According to CNN\'s Poll of Polls, the President stands at 42%, while Quinnipiac\'s January poll placed him at 33%. Those are the kinds of numbers that would leave any White House unsettled. The fate of the Build Back Better legislation remains precarious, while the President\'s emboldened words about the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act were tougher than ever. On Tuesday, he asked elected officials, ""Do you want to be on the side of Dr. King or George Wallace?"" in what appeared to be a question implicitly targeting Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who still refuse to accept the filibuster carve-out that would allow the voting rights legislation to overcome Republican opposition. Even worse, Omicron has driven up hospitalizations and left huge swaths of the population despondent about when the pandemic will come to an end. ""It\'s déjà vu all over again,"" as the baseball legend Yogi Berra liked to say. Obama backs Biden\'s call to change Senate rules to pass voting rights in op-edOthers complain that the President isn\'t even doing a good job showcasing his many accomplishments. ""Jobs, jabs, infrastructure, prosperity and peace,"" one columnist urged in a piece criticizing Biden for failing to boast enough about what his administration has done. Then there is inflation. Rising prices are overwhelming all good economic news in recent days, including low unemployment and a buoyant economy. Although initially many economists thought that the price increases would be ""transitory,"" the widely accepted outlook is that inflation will remain high for a while. One Nevada voter, Laura Godinez, who told CNN she used to lean Republican but had shifted toward the Democrats in recent elections, commented: ""I don\'t want to say this, but when Donald Trump was here, it was nothing like this."" Does this all add up to a doomed presidency? That question will naturally enter into the minds of Democrats as they speculate about where this is heading, particularly with the distinct possibility that Trump could run again in 2024.  Read MoreThose who are worried should find some solace in the fact that contemporary presidents have been able to come back from difficult moments like these. Challenging first terms don\'t inevitably put a commander in chief on path toward a one-term presidency. It\'s possible to struggle in the polls, deal with difficult economic challenges and criticism from different factions of one\'s own party and still go on to be considered a successful two-term president.  Just look at Ronald Reagan, who served from 1981 until 1989, and is considered one of the most transformative presidents in recent times. In early 1982, Reagan was struggling to stay above water. The economy had entered into a serious recession, a result of the anti-inflationary moves of Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. Democrats were furious about Reagan\'s efforts to gut the social safety net, while many conservatives feared that the president was unwilling to go far enough. Reagan\'s approval ratings fell to 46%, according to a Washington Post-ABC poll in May 1982. (While that was higher than Biden\'s current ratings, it was low compared to Lyndon B. Johnson at a similar moment in his presidency (67%) or Richard Nixon (66%).Reagan was veering closer to Jimmy Carter (43%) and Gerald Ford (45%). In August 1982, Reagan\'s approval fell to 41%, according to Gallup. Kevin McCarthy\'s comment is a warning signBut conditions started to change dramatically in 1983 and 1984. As the economy rebounded, so too did Reagan\'s standing. The president finally found his footing, figuring out a way to identify himself with the nation\'s economic recovery and to calm the nerves of conservatives who wanted him to go much further on issues such as limiting reproductive rights. He used the themes of tax cuts and anti-communism to hold his coalition together. In 1984, he touted his willingness to stand up to the Soviet Union and ran an ad declaring it was ""Morning in America."" That year, Reagan won a landslide victory against Democrat Walter Mondale.  A few years later, Democrat Bill Clinton was also struggling in his second year in office. The president had gotten off to a rocky start, with some high-profile nominations going down in flames. The recession, which was one of the reasons Clinton won the election, didn\'t go away as quickly as he hoped. Clinton\'s controversial health care plan in 1993 seemed to anger almost everyone: liberals preferred a single-payer system to his regulatory approach to lowering costs and conservatives blasted the plan as socialism. The administration\'s success at raising taxes on upper income Americans also energized the GOP.In June 1993, his approval rating had fallen to 37%, according to Gallup. When Republicans swept the 1994 midterms, taking control of both chambers of Congress for the first time since 1955, it didn\'t take long for pundits to speculate that Clinton would end up being a one-term president like his predecessor, George H.W. Bush. ""I want my presidency back,"" Clinton allegedly said in a moment of frustration to a group of close advisers. He found a way. As a result of the government shutdowns in 1995 and 1996, support for the administration started to rise, as voters blamed House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his fellow Republicans for the dysfunction in Washington. Mike Pence may soon face a fateful choiceThe president\'s tough stand following the Oklahoma City bombing in April 1995 generated widespread praise. Following the advice of strategist Dick Morris, Clinton shifted to the center on a number of issues, including welfare reform, stealing thunder from Republicans. And the economy started to grow. Despite the anger that emerged from the left about his centrist shift, overall, the strategy put him in strong position to defeat Republican Robert Dole in 1996. Clinton presented himself as a bridge to the future while casting Dole as a bridge to the past. Even though House Republicans would vote to impeach the president in 1998, he ended his second term with approval ratings at 66%, according to Gallup. And, certainly, Biden remembers the experience of President Barack Obama, under whom he served. Obama took over under terrible circumstances, and his first few years were anything but fun. He started his term with the nation still reeling from the implosion of financial markets in 2008. American troops were also bogged down in an unsuccessful and unpopular war in Iraq. When the president moved forward with a major health care proposal, the Affordable Care Act, he triggered fierce opposition from conservatives and left many congressional Democrats fearful about the cost they would pay for the plan.  Even the passage of the legislation didn\'t allay those concerns, as ACA was initially not popular with voters.  As with Clinton, many on the left were unhappy. They thought that Obama was moving too far to the center. As with Biden, there were also concerns that the president was not doing enough to tout his accomplishments, including a major economic stimulus bill that helped put the nation on the right path. Obama\'s approval ratings dropped from 68% at the start of his presidency to 46% in October 2010. The midterm elections, which returned control of the House to Republicans, felt devastating. He admitted to being ""humbled"" by the outcome, which he called a ""shellacking.""But Obama also recovered and thrived. Americans began to feel the effects of the economic rebound, and the president found his political footing during standoffs with Tea Party Republicans who were pushing the GOP toward new extremes, such as when they threatened to send the nation into default by not raising the debt ceiling.

Mitt Romney. Once again, Obama ran an effective campaign, reviving hope about the promise of his political vision and painting Romney as a right-wing figure who had little compassion for those who were struggling economically. Obama, of course, went on to win reelection and left office with his approval ratings at about 59%, remaining a hugely influential figure in the party. While Biden\'s current challenges are very real, they shouldn\'t be seen as a clear indication of where his presidency is headed. This challenging moment is a snapshot of his term rather than the conclusion. In modern times, we have seen many presidents recover from a difficult start. Not everyone ends up like Carter, H.W. Bush or Trump, one-term presidents who campaigned for reelection under poor conditions (Carter was dealing with the Iran-Hostage crisis and stagflation; H.W. Bush with the recession; Trump with the pandemic and ongoing political turmoil). It\'s possible that Biden\'s troubles will fade, and he and the nation will eventually look back on a successful two-term administration.

(CNN)Former Vice President Mike Pence contrasted Democrats\' push for election legislation with his own actions at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, in an op-ed published in The Washington Post on Friday. Pence, in the piece headlined ""Jan. 6 was a power grab. So is busting the filibuster to nationalize elections,"" writes, ""On Jan. 6, an angry mob ransacked the Capitol, largely to try to get Congress and me, as the president of the Senate, to use federal authority to overturn results of the presidential election that had been certified by all 50 states"" and credits law enforcement with securing the Capitol. He goes on to accuse President Joe Biden and Senate Democrats of using the memory of the riot to ""attempt another federal power grab over our state elections."" ""Their plan to end the filibuster to allow Democrats to pass a bill nationalizing our elections would offend the Founders\' intention that states conduct elections just as much as what some of our most ardent supporters would have had me do one year ago,"" Pence writes.His rebuke comes as the Senate is poised to take up voting legislation on Tuesday. Biden has aggressively pushed for the Senate to change its filibuster rules in order to clear the way for the legislation to pass with fewer votes but has faced opposition to the rules change from moderate Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Read MorePence says in his opinion piece that during the January 6 election certification, he upheld the principle that elections are determined at the state level -- not by Congress. On that day, he had rejected then-President Donald Trump\'s entreaties to subvert the constitutional process that would certify Biden\'s election victory, earning Trump\'s wrath. After the mob breached the Capitol, Pence was rushed out of the Senate chamber as rioters calling for his death stormed the halls.""The notion that Congress would break the filibuster rule to pass a law equaling a wholesale takeover of elections by the federal government is inconsistent with our nation\'s history and an affront to our Constitution\'s structure,"" Pence writes in the op-ed, before going on to criticize proposals in the election legislation.In the piece, the former vice president praised states that passed restrictive voting laws last year, such as Texas and Georgia, writing that they ""led the way with common-sense reforms"" in an attempt ""to restore confidence in the integrity of our elections.""  Pence called on senators to ""do as you did before: Uphold the right of states to conduct and certify elections. Reject this latest attempt to give Washington the power to decide how the United States\' elections are run. And keep the oath you made before God and the American people to support and defend the Constitution.""', 'Senate Democrats press White House on Covid-19 testing shortageBy Eva McKend and Veronica Stracqualursi, CNNUpdated 7:56 PM ET, Fri January 14, 2022 JUST WATCHEDFormer WH Covid Adviser defends testing shortageReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFormer WH Covid Adviser defends testing shortage 09:08 (CNN)The Biden administration is facing intense scrutiny from a small group of Senate Democrats about the administration\'s Covid-19 pandemic response, mainly the testing shortage as cases of the Omicron variant have surged across the United States. In a letter to White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeffrey Zients on Thursday, led by Nevada Sen. Jacky Rosen, the groups asks, ""why the Administration failed to take more significant steps earlier to increase access to at-home tests.""While praising the administration\'s efforts to promote and distribute vaccines, the group is fiercely critical of the slowness to get tests out across the country. ""Far too many measures -- such as increasing access to home-based testing -- have been reactive, rather than proactive,"" the letter reads.""This Administration either knew or should have known that testing shortages were occurring across the country over the past several months, and with the full expectation that the virus would likely mutate into a new variant steps to increase testing access should have happened before the current wave hit, not several weeks into the surge, with resources still not available until later this month or beyond.""Read MoreThe senators are calling on the administration to improve preparedness to ensure they are not caught off guard again and asking if they need Congress\' help to address the current spike in cases. The letter is also signed by Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Jon Ossoff of Georgia. A White House official told CNN in a statement Friday evening that ""we are in contact with our colleagues at the Hill about a range of issues related to our COVID-19 response, and share their goal of expanding access to free, at home testing"" and cited administration efforts such as increasing the number of tests on the market since August and using the Defense Production Act ""regularly to accelerate manufacturing.""""While we are not where we would like to be with at home testing, neither are most countries due to unprecedented demand,"" the official said. ""Every day more supply arrives on the market. We are looking forward, and are encouraged by our actions, which are now allowing the President to purchase an unprecedented 1 billion at home tests that will be made available to the American people for free."" On Monday, a group of 50 lawmakers, including some high-profile Biden allies, such as independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, also wrote a letter to President Joe Biden, urging ""additional, immediate steps"" to ramp up testing supply so that every American has access to one rapid test a week.Since the holidays, Covid-19 at-home tests have been difficult to find and there have been long lines at many testing facilities across the US.Biden announced Thursday that he\'s directing his team to procure another 500 million Covid-19 rapid tests in addition to the 500 million tests he announced last month would be distributed for free nationwide. Biden also said the website where Americans can sign up for free tests to be mailed to them will be rolled out next week. More details are expected Friday, according to a White House official.But the administration is still in the process of acquiring the first half-billion Covid-19 tests and only last week began signing contracts to procure them. The White House said it expected the first free rapid tests to be delivered to the government ""early next week.""This story has been updated with additional details Friday.CNN\'s Jasmine Wright contributed to this report.', 'US officials believe Russia arrested hacker responsible for Colonial Pipeline attackBy Sean Lyngaas, CNNUpdated 6:07 PM ET, Fri January 14, 2022 In an aerial view, fuel holding tanks are seen at Colonial Pipeline\'s Dorsey Junction Station on May 13, 2021, in Woodbine, Maryland. Washington (CNN)The US believes that Russia\'s domestic intelligence agency has arrested the hacker responsible for the May ransomware attack that forced a major US fuel pipeline to shut down for days, a senior Biden administration official told reporters Friday.It appears to mark a rare instance of US-Russian cooperation against a major cybercrime group, following direct appeals from President Joe Biden to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The cyberattack against Colonial Pipeline in May prompted the company to preemptively shut down its fuel distribution operations, leading to widespread shortages at gas stations along the East Coast.The official spoke to reporters after Russia\'s FSB intelligence agency said Friday that, at the behest of US authorities, it had detained multiple people associated with REvil, a type of ransomware that has cost US firms millions of dollars.The US and Russia do not have an extradition treaty.

Paul in heated exchange (CNN)Starting Saturday, many Americans can get home Covid-19 tests at no cost through their private insurance. They can obtain the tests from pharmacies, retailers and online vendors.The program is part of the Biden administration's effort to increase access to testing around the US. It will also distribute free home tests, which will be available to order starting next Wednesday. Here's what you need to know about getting free home tests from retailers:How does this work?Most Americans with private insurance can buy home tests online or in stores and have them paid for at the time of purchase or get reimbursed by submitting a claim to their insurer. So make sure you save your receipts.Read MoreThe tests won't be subject to copays or deductibles.Insurers may set up a network of preferred stores, pharmacies and online retailers where consumers can receive tests at no cost up front. People could still buy tests outside that network, but insurers would only have to reimburse up to $12 for each one.Consumers should contact their insurers to find out if they provide direct coverage or if claims must be submitted.Do I need a doctor's order or prescription?No, you will not need to visit a doctor to get the free tests.How many tests can I get?Insurers must pay for up to eight tests per covered individual per month. So a family of four could get 32 tests each month, for instance.What about all the tests I bought before Saturday? Can I get reimbursed for them?Sorry, but only tests bought starting January 15 qualify.Where can I find a home test?Finding home tests is proving challenging in many parts of the country, even as retailers limit the number that can be purchased by one customer.It's one reason why the Biden administration plans to distribute free home tests soon. President Joe Biden on Thursday announced he was doubling the number that will be available to 1 billion.Several states have also ordered home tests to be distributed free to residents, but supplies have been limited.How do I get one of those free federal tests?Americans can go to a new website, covidtests.gov, to order the tests, starting January 19. Tests are expected to ship within seven to 12 days of being ordered.Initially, there will be a limit of four tests per residential household.The White House will also set up a hotline for those who cannot order online but has not yet announced a launch date for it.What if I'm on Medicare?Medicare covers at no charge Covid-19 testing done in a lab when ordered by a medical professional. Those enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans should check with their insurers to see if the costs of the home tests will be covered.What if I'm on Medicaid?Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, already cover home tests with no cost-sharing. But enrollees should contact their state agencies for specific coverage details.What if I'm uninsured?The uninsured can get free home tests from certain community health centers. They can also request tests through the federal program once it becomes available.Also, the Department of Health and Human Services is providing up to 50 million free home tests to community health centers and Medicare-certified health clinics for distribution to patients and the community.HHS also has established more than 10,000 free community-based pharmacy testing sites around the country.

If Arizona does not make changes to those programs within 60 days, the Treasury Department could start recouping the funds that are being spent in violation of eligible uses, according to a letter sent to Gov. Doug Ducey\'s office. One program Treasury officials have concerns about is the $163 million Education Plus-Up Grant Program, which awards money to Arizona schools that do not require the use of masks and are open for in-person learning. The other is the state\'s Covid-19 Educational Recovery Benefit Program, which is available only to families of students whose current or prior school requires the use of masks. It\'s meant to provide up to $7,000 per student whose parents are facing financial and educational barriers due to mask mandates and ""unnecessary closures,"" according to a state website.  As schools battle Omicron, billions of federal relief dollars remain unspentThe conditions imposed on these grants ""undermine efforts to stop the spread of Covid-19 and discourage compliance with evidence-based solutions for stopping the spread of Covid-19,"" the Treasury Department letter said. Read MoreDucey signed a ban on school mask mandates into law in June, but it was ruled unconstitutional by a state judge in September -- a decision later upheld by the Arizona Supreme Court. Some schools had chosen to defy the governor and implement a mask mandate even before the judge\'s ruling.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to recommend indoor masking in K-12 schools for students, teachers and staff, regardless of vaccination status.A spokesman for the governor\'s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. RELATED: Biden administration will provide K-12 schools with additional 10 million Covid-19 tests per monthThe federal money in dispute was authorized by the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which President Joe Biden signed into law in March. The relief package created a $350 billion Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds program that sent state, local and tribal governments a pot of money to support their responses to the pandemic. The money can be used for a wide range of expenses, including providing a boost in pay to essential workers, helping small businesses recover from the pandemic and replacing lost public sector revenue. The American Rescue Plan also sent $128 billion directly to school districts. Much of that money is still available and schools have more than three years to spend it. Staffing, summer learning and after-school programs, HVAC systems, mental health programs and technology to aid remote learning are some of the top priorities, according to a review of state spending plans by FutureED, a nonpartisan think tank at Georgetown University.', 'Biden announces new program to repair and replace bridgesBy Sam Fossum and Kate Sullivan, CNNUpdated 2:11 PM ET, Fri January 14, 2022 President Joe Biden delivers a speech on infrastructure while visiting the NH 175 bridge in November, in Woodstock, New Hampshire. The visit to the bridge, listed in poor condition since 2013, followed the signing of the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill. (CNN)President Joe Biden on Friday announced a new program to repair and replace the nation\'s bridges through funding from the bipartisan infrastructure law that passed Congress in November. ""My bipartisan infrastructure law includes the largest investment in our nation\'s bridges since the creation of the Interstate Highway System. Bridges to connect us, bridges to make America work,"" Biden said at the White House.Biden said: ""There\'s a lot of talk about disappointments and things we haven\'t gotten done -- we\'re gonna get a lot of them done, I might add -- but this is something we did get done.""The President on Friday took the opportunity to shift the focus back to one of his biggest legislative achievements since taking office after several recent setbacks to his agenda. Nearly one year into his presidency and with the November midterm elections creeping closer, the future of the President\'s economic agenda is uncertain, his push for voting rights has so far not yielded any success, the Supreme Court struck down his vaccine mandates for big businesses, the pandemic is still raging and key economic indicators out this week reflect record inflation.Read MoreBiden spoke about bridges he has personally visited in New Hampshire, New Jersey and Louisiana that are in need of repairs and stressed the important role bridges play in communities. The President visited several bridges as he attempted to sell his infrastructure law, which ultimately passed Congress with support from both Republicans and Democrats, to the American people. ""People have written me about bridges they depend on,"" Biden said. ""One man told me that the bridge he traveled on every day is a tragedy waiting to happen. One woman wrote that a bridge near the center of her town had to be closed and now drivers and tourists bypass downtown, consequently devastating local businesses.""The President said: ""One person wrote to me to say \'This is your chance to show the people in my area that they matter to you.\' "" ""I hear you. I hear you,"" Biden continued. ""You do matter to me, and we are going to get it done.""There are more than 43,000 bridges in poor condition across the country, according to 2021 data from the National Bridge Inventory. The US Department of Transportation\'s Federal Highway Administration is launching the Bridge Formula Program, which will provide $26.5 billion to states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico over the next five years, as well as $825 million for tribal bridges, according to a senior administration official. Here\'s what\'s in the bipartisan infrastructure packageThe official added that the Federal Highway Administration will distribute $5.3 billion to states, DC and Puerto Rico during the 2021 fiscal year, along with $155 million to tribes, the official added. Experts have argued that updates and repairs of the nation\'s infrastructure could play an important role in moving goods and people across the country more efficiently and could help prevent a future supply chain crisis. The country\'s current infrastructure system received a C- score from the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2021.""This is an investment is going to help connect entire towns and regions to new opportunities,"" Biden said. ""With this investment we\'re sending a message to those communities and to the people who call them home: You matter. We\'re building back and building back better with you. We\'re making sure you\'re not left behind or left out.""The program is expected to improve 15,000 highway bridges, according to the official, as well as ""off system"" bridges that carry smaller roads and are not part of the federal highway system. Under the new program, the entire cost of repairing or rehabilitating ""off system"" bridges can be covered with federal funds. Funding from the program also can be used to make bridges more accessible to cyclists and pedestrians. Biden\'s infrastructure implementation coordinator, Mitch Landrieu, said Friday his team was focused on allocating the large sum of money efficiently so that Americans see tangible benefits from the law. ""Since we haven\'t spent this kind of money on infrastructure in generations, we\'re also talking about how to do it with accountability,"" Landrieu said, speaking from the White House. ""Making sure we can be good stewards of the taxpayers\' dollars and deliver results on time on task and on budget.""The $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law includes $550 billion in new infrastructure investments that range from roads and bridges to airports, mass transit, waterways and energy systems.This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Friday.', 'First on CNN: US intelligence indicates Russia preparing operation to justify invasion of UkraineBy Natasha Bertrand and Jeremy Herb, CNNUpdated 1:29 PM ET, Fri January 14, 2022 JUST WATCHEDUkraine is Putin\'s \'last stand\', says Russia expertReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH (16 Videos)Ukraine is Putin\'s \'last stand\', says Russia expertUS quietly authorized 200 million dollars for Ukraine securitySee the massive fossil being excavated in UK reservoirThis is how much the climate crisis cost in 2021 Amanpour presses Kazakh official: Do you support shoot-to-kill orders?Djokovic\'s detention in Australia sheds light on refugee crisisWatch these escaped ostriches go on the run Lockdown measures spark public outrage in Xi\'an, China\'We\'re not thugs or terrorists\': Kazakh protester responds to president\'s blameExplained: How much damage can North Korea\'s weapons do?\ufeffResidents pushed to the limits in Chinese city under strict lockdownWatch as protests erupt in Kazakhstan over skyrocketing fuel prices14 years ago Beijing held a different kind of OlympicsHow is Omicron different?

But the talks failed to achieve any breakthroughs, as Russia would not commit to de-escalating and American and NATO officials said Moscow\'s demands -- including that NATO never admit Ukraine into the alliance -- were non-starters.A number of Ukraine\'s governmental websites were hit by a cyberattack on Friday, a development European officials warned would ratchet up tensions over Ukraine even further. \'We saw this playbook\'The US official said that the Biden administration believes Russia could be preparing for an invasion into Ukraine ""that may result in widespread human rights violations and war crimes should diplomacy fail to meet their objectives.""""The Russian military plans to begin these activities several weeks before a military invasion, which could begin between mid-January and mid-February,"" the official said. ""We saw this playbook in 2014 with Crimea.""Kirby said that Putin is likely directly aware of Russian false-flag operatives that could be the pretext for an operation in Ukraine.""If past is prologue, it is difficult to see that these kinds of activities could be, would be done without the knowledge if not the imprimatur of the very senior levels of the Russian government,"" Kirby told reporters Friday.Cyberattack hits Ukraine government websites The US has also seen Russian influence actors begin to prime Russian audiences for an intervention, the official said, including by emphasizing narratives about the deterioration of human rights in Ukraine and increased militancy of Ukrainian leaders.""During December, Russian language content on social media covering all three of these narratives increased to an average of nearly 3,500 posts per day, a 200% increase from the daily average in November,"" the official noted.The US, NATO and European officials held high-stakes meetings this week with Russian officials. At the end of the three meetings on Thursday, both sides came away with a pessimistic outlook. Russia\'s deputy foreign minister suggested the talks had reached a ""dead-end"" and saw no reason to continue them, while a senior US official warned that the ""drumbeat of war was sounding loud"" following the diplomatic sessions.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Friday that Russia believes NATO will increase its activity along its border with Ukraine if Moscow doesn\'t obey the West\'s demands.""While our proposals are aimed at reducing the military confrontation, de-escalating the overall situation in Europe, exactly the opposite is happening in the West. NATO members are building up their strength and aviation. In the territories that are directly adjacent to Ukraine, on the Black Sea, the scale of exercises has increased many times recently,"" Lavrov said.Ukraine government websites hit by cyberattackUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has invited President Joe Biden and Putin to hold three-way talks to discuss the security situation, said Zelensky aide Andriy Yermak, according to Ukrainian state media outlet Ukrinform.On Friday, a number of Ukrainian government websites, including its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, were targeted in a cyberattack with threatening text that warned Ukrainians to ""be afraid and wait for the worst."" Ukraine\'s government said that it appeared Russia was behind the attack. Tensions are high on Ukraine\'s border with Russia. Here\'s what you need to knowA US National Security Council official said the President Joe Biden had been briefed on the attack. The official said the US did not have an attribution for the attack yet but would ""provide Ukraine with whatever support it needs to recover.""The Pentagon said that it was too soon to attribute the attack, though Kirby noted, ""This is of a piece of the same kind of playbook we\'ve seen from Russia in the past."" The European Union\'s chief diplomat Josep Borrell condemned the cyberattack, warning it contributes to the ""already tense situation"" in the region.When asked if Russian governmental or non-governmental actors were behind the attacks, Borrell responded that although he didn\'t want to ""point fingers,"" there was ""a certain probability as to where they came from.""

In a majority of states, less than 20% of the federal money had been spent by the end of November, according to the latest US Department of Education data. ""The barriers to reopening are not tied to money,"" said Chad Aldeman, policy director at Edunomics Lab, a research center at Georgetown University.""Few districts can say money is an issue right now for reopening decisions. If they wanted to give every student and staff member masks, if they wanted to send devices to each student -- they can do it,"" Aldeman added. The federal funds can be used for a broad range of pandemic-related needs, like buying masks and Covid-19 tests, adding staff members or offering retention bonuses to teachers. But just because districts have the money doesn\'t mean they can quickly fill open positions or acquire enough tests, especially if they didn\'t anticipate the latest case surge caused by the highly transmissible Omicron coronavirus variant.Read More""A lot of reopening decisions right now are driven by nonfinancial factors,"" Aldeman said. Schools have 3 years to spend the moneyThe Covid relief money, which came from three different pieces of legislation, is a huge federal investment equal to roughly six times the amount of fiscal year 2021 base funding. Congress gave schools more than three years to spend the latest and biggest round of money delivered by the American Rescue Plan that was passed in March. Totaling $128 billion, it\'s unlikely to be spent all at once, especially if it\'s used for teachers\' salaries or capital improvements that are paid for over time.The funds first flowed to state education agencies, which then reimburse local school districts once they make a purchase or pay salaries, for example. The Department of Education released two-thirds of the money to states in March and sent the remaining funds once it approved a state\'s plan for using the money. The department approved the final state plan, submitted by Florida, last week.""There are some things that schools want to spend the money on immediately to address urgent needs, but there\'s a balance to strike,"" said Danny Carlson, associate executive director of policy and advocacy at the National Association of Elementary School Principals.""Omicron has shown why it\'s important to budget strategically so you\'re well positioned to respond to the pandemic as it continues to evolve,"" he added. The decentralized nature of the US school system makes it difficult to track how and when districts are spending the money. Experts say the data collected is often too vague to shine light on how exactly the money is being spent or determine what impact it\'s having on students. State portals are generally updated more frequently than the federal tracking system.Spending money on staffing, summer learning and after-school programs, HVAC systems, mental health programs and technology to aid remote learning are some of the top priorities, according to a review of state spending plans by FutureED, a nonpartisan think tank at Georgetown University.Schools are in chaosUnpredictable school closings and reopenings are exhausting parents, who need to scramble to find child care and also worry about their children\'s mental health and whether they\'re receiving a good education.Many schools delayed reopening at the start of 2022, opting to extend winter breaks due to the Omicron surge. While the vast majority of schools were operating as normal, more than 5,000 schools did not offer in-person learning for at least one day during the first two weeks of January, according to data company Burbio, which aggregates data based on school calendars and other sources.Large districts like Chicago, Los Angeles and Atlanta returned to in-person learning this week, but others -- like public schools in Cincinnati and Indianapolis -- are going virtual again due to high Covid-19 case rates and teacher absences.""In reality, some districts have been able to handle the latest surge better than others. Leadership and planning are having an impact,"" Carlson said. In Washington, DC, and Richmond, Virginia, for example, the school districts made free Covid-19 tests available for pickup before students returned to school after the winter break. Biden is sending more Covid-19 testsSome federal lawmakers are feeling pressure to respond to the moment. Despite the availability of funds, there was discussion on Capitol Hill about passing another economic relief package before talks stalled in late December, CNN reported. President Joe Biden recently said that schools should remain open and that they have the money to do so. ""You know, they have what they need because of the American Rescue Plan,"" he said.But House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters on Tuesday that he expects the White House will request Congress to provide more funding for testing, vaccines and ""to make sure schools have the resources to keep themselves safe.""On Wednesday, the Biden administration announced that it plans to start distributing 5 million free rapid tests and 5 million free PCR tests to schools each month. Public health experts have repeatedly stressed the need for expanded Covid-19 testing in schools, but it\'s unclear whether 10 million free tests per month will make a significant impact for the roughly 48 million students enrolled in grades K-12 across the country.A recent decision by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to shorten the number of days infected teachers and staff should isolate from 10 to five days could help alleviate the staffing problems some schools are experiencing.CNN\'s Annie Grayer contributed to this report.', 'FEMA administrator to announce expanded flexibility for National Guard to help support hospitalsBy Betsy Klein, CNNUpdated 12:16 PM ET, Fri January 14, 2022 Deanne Criswell, then- nominee to be the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is seen in March 2021.  (CNN)Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Deanne Criswell announced at Friday\'s White House press briefing new steps from the Biden administration to help alleviate staffing shortages at hospitals across the country amid the spread of the Omicron variant.On Thursday, an administration official told CNN, Criswell ""directed an expansion of FEMA policy to support Governors in using their National Guard to meet urgent staffing needs at healthcare facilities.""This direction from FEMA, which was previewed exclusively to CNN, means that governors have more flexibility to use National Guard members for support services at hospitals.""Now, FEMA has granted governors flexibility to perform vital support missions at primary medical facilities when, in the judgment of public health officials, doing so is necessary to sustain the provision of Covid-19 medical care at those facilities and failure to do so would constitute an immediate threat to the public health and safety,"" the official said.Those extra services National Guard members can now provide include ""activities like linen and laundry services, food preparation and delivery, biomedical waste removal, perimeter fencing, contracted security guards, professional cleaning and other related services,"" the official said.National Guard steps in to alleviate pressure on hospital overwhelmed by Omicron waveRead MoreThat expanded help comes as cases continue to surge and hospitalizations rise. ""As critical as our doctors and nurses are, countless other professionals keep our hospitals running. Patient transporters, food workers, and cleaning staff are all at the heart of these healthcare facilities,"" Criswell said at Friday\'s briefing. She continued, ""For that reason, with the President\'s support, I directed an expansion of FEMA policy to permit funding to states who elect to use their National Guard troops to fill these critical support roles in hospitals."" Some states\' health care systems are beset with nearly-full intensive care units. Nineteen states have less than 15% remaining capacity in their ICUs. Four of them have less than 10%: Kentucky, Alabama, Indiana and New Hampshire, according to data Wednesday from the US Department of Health and Human Services. The rising cases have led to decreased staffing at hospitals, from doctors to support staff.President Joe Biden announced Thursday that the US has deployed 120 military medical personnel to six additional hard-hit states: Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Rhode Island and New Mexico.Since Thanksgiving, he said, more than 800 military and other federal personnel have been deployed across 24 states, tribes, and territories, including more than 350 military doctors, nurses, and medics. More than 14,000 National Guard members are also activated in 49 states. All of those deployments, he noted, are fully paid for by the Covid relief package passed by Congress early last year. He said he has also directed FEMA to ensure there is enough hospital bed capacity in every state.Friday\'s announcement is meant to alleviate additional personnel shortages. The use of the National Guard will be paid for by FEMA, as authorized by Biden, through April 1.This story has been updated with additional developments Friday.', 'GOP zeroes in on Biden\'s immigration record ahead of midterm electionsBy Priscilla Alvarez, CNNUpdated 10:51 AM ET, Fri January 14, 2022 Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott arrives for a news conference in Mission, Texas, on October 6, 2021. Abbott, who\'s up for reelection, has hammered the Biden administration over the arrival of thousands of migrants at the border.  (CNN)As ambitious Republicans plot their return to power in the midterm elections and in statewide races across the country, a familiar face is ready and willing to help them capitalize on President Joe Biden\'s sagging poll numbers on immigration.Stephen Miller, the architect of former President Donald Trump\'s immigration policy, is among a group of policy hawks urging Republican Party officials and candidates to exploit what they describe as Biden\'s glaring vulnerability, after crises on the border. GOP plots onslaught of Biden probes in the run-up to 2024""I\'m very open about the fact that I believe the Republican Party needs to really dig in starting now, and work and put in the work to elevate this issue to the center of our national dialogue,"" Miller told CNN, adding he\'s been in discussions with Republican Party officials and candidates who he has prior relationships with. He\'s among a group of Trump White House aides who will be formally advising the Pennsylvania US Senate campaign of David McCormick, a Republican hedge fund executive, a person familiar with the campaign told CNN.But with or without Miller\'s direct input, immigration is set to vex Democrats. The ebbs and flows of migration patterns are generally out of the control of any sitting US president, but Biden has faced mounds of criticism from both the left and the right. Read MoreMost recently, the White House made an about-face on whether migrant families separated under the Trump administration deserve compensation. Initially Biden said they did, but after intense criticism, his administration walked away from the negotiations, which had reportedly included a figure of up to $450,000 per individual affected by the policy, and now the Justice Department has outlined its arguments against payment in a recent court filing.The administration\'s immigration policy challenges come as Biden\'s approval rating has sagged. A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday finds the President\'s approval rating at 33% approve to 53% disapprove, with another 13% not offering opinions. Other relatively recent surveys have shown him with a somewhat higher approval rating, but similar numbers on disapproval.And in December, a survey found that Biden\'s approval ratings on immigration -- 40% -- stood below his overall approval number at the time.Supporters of President Donald Trump chant ""Latinos for Trump!"" during a campaign rally on October 28, 2020, in Goodyear, Arizona. As a result, Republican strategists expect immigration to play a significant role in primaries this year following months of criticism over the administration\'s handling of the US-Mexico border. ""When it gets to how does it look for the next year, I think you\'ll see it a lot in primary races, and I think you\'ll see it in more conservative districts and if a candidate is underperforming among Republican voters,"" one Republican strategist told CNN. But focusing solely on immigration is unlikely to help sway swing voters, the strategist warned, and will instead be cited as a failure of the Biden administration, among other issues.  In Arizona, where there\'s a key US Senate race, state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who\'s sued the Biden administration over immigration policies, listed border security in a video launching his campaign for the Senate, showcasing a headline about his fight to ""retain Trump immigration rules.""In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott, who\'s up for reelection, has similarly challenged policies in court and hammered the Biden administration over the arrival of thousands of migrants at the US southern border. And it\'s not confined to border states. In Pennsylvania, Republican candidate for governor Lou Barletta jumped on flights transporting migrants to the state -- a routine practice. ""It\'s nothing that Republicans need to do to make it an issue. It\'s become an issue,"" said Dave Carney, a Republican political consultant, referring to border security. Some observers argue that the administration\'s lack of strategy on immigration has contributed to confusion and frustration. That\'s a concern for Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas. Cuellar, who has been critical of the administration\'s approach to the border, told CNN he\'s repeatedly heard from constituents who share similar concerns.""They think Democrats are pretty much more open borders. They feel that they\'re not doing enough,"" Cuellar said. ""The Republicans have certainly jumped on that issue.""A dramatic increase in number of migrants seeking asylum in Arizona overwhelms Border PatrolIt could be a particularly difficult subject for Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, who\'s seen as one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the Senate. The Arizona-Mexico border has recently faced a surge of migrants that\'s overwhelmed resources. Despite a Democratic victory in the state in 2020, Republicans are buoyant that voters have soured on Democratic control and will punish the party at the ballot box in 2022.The Biden administration has held on to some Trump-era policies, including a public health order allowing for the swift expulsion of migrants encountered at the border and, in the wake of a lower court decision, a policy forcing migrants to stay in Mexico until their US immigration court dates. But that hasn\'t shielded Biden from criticism from the right, and has instead fueled frustration on the left. Immigrant advocacy groups repeatedly expressed their disappointment with the administration maintaining Trump-era border policies and expelling thousands of migrants encountered at the border over the last year. ""One side is filling the zone with a narrative and the other side is saying virtually nothing. As a result, many swing voters who found Trump\'s cruelty abhorrent are upset at Biden for what they call minding the store and not having a plan,"" said Frank Sharry, president of America\'s Voice, an immigrant advocacy group.  ""Democratic candidates are going to have to both compete on who has the better solution, who has the best immigration solution, and by pivoting to issues that motivate Democratic voters,"" he added. Anti-immigrant groups see an opportunity to lean into that this year. ""How can the Republican political apparatus not seize on what is the most, the second most, clear obvious political opportunity that Biden has laid open for Republican candidates?"" said Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, citing inflation as the first issue. The group plans to invest millions in issue-based ads this year and roll out additional Spanish-language ads -- a first for the group, Stein said.Arturo Vargas, chief executive officer of NALEO Educational Fund, warned of viewing Hispanics as a single-issue electorate but noted that campaign ads in English and Spanish are generally important to reaching all segments of the electorate. In 2020, Trump, despite his hardline immigration policies, made inroads among voters in Hispanic areas nationwide. The Republican National Committee plans to capitalize on that and ramp up its outreach to Hispanic voters, according to spokesperson Emma Vaughn.""The issue of immigration cannot be synonymous with the Latino issue, which too often happens with candidates and campaigns,"" Vargas said. ""There are certainly segments of the Latino electorate for whom immigration reform is a top priority and they\'ll hold candidates accountable for whether they\'ll get immigration reform.""To that end, Democratic lawmakers have pledged to continue seeking a path for immigration revisions after the Senate parliamentarian rejected multiple attempts to include immigration provisions in the Build Back Better legislation.', 'Takeaways from the landmark sedition indictment against the Oath Keepers and why DOJ acted nowBy Marshall Cohen, CNNUpdated 8:49 AM ET, Fri January 14, 2022 JUST WATCHEDSee the messages Oath Keepers leader sent to followersReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH (16 Videos)See the messages Oath Keepers leader sent to followers\'Shameless\': Avlon reacts to McCarthy\'s press conferenceDOJ files rarely-used \'seditious conspiracy\' charges against January 6 defendants Why the Supreme Court decided against vaccine mandateHear why Sinema is concerned about eliminating filibusterThe case against a 2024 Hillary Clinton candidacy Senator says he\'s \'glad\' Biden went a \'little too far\' in voting rights speechHear how McCarthy\'s words on 1/6 have changed in a year\'Extraordinarily painful to watch\': GOP senator under fire for remarks about Black judicial nomineeEfforts to reform 19th century law could decide who is president in 2024Lindsey Graham picks side in Trump vs. McConnell divideCNN reporter explains what GOP is plotting if they win majority\'It looks bleak, honestly\': Gloria Borger on Biden\'s push to pass voting rights billsFauci calls Republican senator a \'moron\' under his breath during tense hearingReporter explains why McConnell isn\'t talking about TrumpTrump attacks McConnell in new interview (CNN)The Justice Department on Thursday announced the first sedition charges related to the January 6 insurrection, a watershed moment in the year-long investigation. The case revolves around the Oath Keepers, a far-right extremist group, and its leader Stewart Rhodes. Many of the defendants were already facing charges for storming the US Capitol building and deny wrongdoing. But the new indictment raises the stakes significantly and made public new details about their alleged plans for violence.Attorney General Merrick Garland had balked at the earlier efforts to bring the seditious conspiracy charge. But in the months since, people briefed on the matter say FBI investigators and DC federal prosecutors have spent much time building the case, at least in part with the help of cooperators and the benefit of internal communications among the Oath Keepers. Here are the key takeaways:DOJ went there on seditionRead MoreFederal prosecutors have been slammed -- by legal experts, Democratic lawmakers, Donald Trump critics, and media pundits -- for going easy on the rioters. That criticism has now been answered in a big way with the charges of ""seditious conspiracy.""Garland said in a major speech last week that prosecutors would go after the January 6 perpetrators ""at any level... whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy."" Thursday\'s indictment puts some meat on the bones.Oath Keepers leader and 10 others charged with \'seditious conspiracy\' related to US Capitol attackSedition is difficult to prove in court, and an indictment is only the very beginning of a legal case. There are many hoops that prosecutors will need to jump through before they win convictions. But this is a critical first step. It destroys, once and for all, the talking point from those downplaying the events of January 6 that the attack on the Capitol wasn\'t an insurrection because nobody has been charged with sedition.It took a while to reach this point in the investigation. Last March, it seemed like former US Attorney Michael Sherwin, who initially led the investigation, got out ahead of his skis when he said there should be sedition cases. Months passed without anything materializing to back up his assertions. With the new indictment, Sherwin has been vindicated. Extent of preparation for January 6One of the most debated questions about January 6 has been over how much planning there was to invade the Capitol.Thousands of Trump supporters breached Capitol grounds, and a couple thousand got inside the building. But was there a plan? And who knew about the plan?It\'s clear from court filings that for many of the rioters, there was no organized plan. But that\'s not the full story. The sedition case against the Oath Keepers highlights that there were hardened groups of alleged criminals within the mob that essentially planned for war.JUST WATCHEDThe extremist Oath Keepers who planned attack on Capitol ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe extremist Oath Keepers who planned attack on Capitol  04:37Rhodes, the Oath Keepers\' leader, is quoted as telling his supporters that they should prepare for a ""bloody"" operation and that they would need to ""fight"" in a ""war."" One defendant allegedly took an early November trip to Washington to conduct recon for an upcoming ""op."" Communications about the ""bloody"" ""fight"" and ""revolution""  were accompanied by logistical planning, prosecutors alleged, with defendants discussing obtaining and bringing weapons to the Washington area. It could have been worse The indictment provided yet another reminder that January 6 could have been so much worse.Shortly after getting inside the Capitol, one group of Oath Keepers tried to make a coordinated move on the Senate chamber, seemingly as if they were executing a mission. According to the indictment, they ""tried to push their way through"" a line of police, but the officers ""forcibly repelled their advance."" (Other rioters eventually breached the Senate floor and gallery.)Prosecutors added more details of how the Oath Keepers allegedly stockpiled weapons at a nearby hotel in Virginia, just in case they needed to deploy a ""quick reaction force"" into DC. READ: Seditious conspiracy indictment related to US Capitol attackThe charging documents say one defendant, Joshua James, got a message from a friend saying, ""I have friends not far from DC with a lot of weapons and ammo if you get into trouble."" James replied, ""that might be helpful, but we have a s***load of QRF on standby with an arsenal.""Rhodes also amassed weapons and other gear on his way to Washington, DC, before January 6, prosecutors said. He allegedly bought a rifle, a magazine, and other firearms equipment, including sights, mounts, triggers, slings, and an optic plate. Rhodes was on the Capitol grounds on January 6 but hasn\'t been accused of entering the building, though prosecutors have said he ""directed"" his supporters to do so.The plot was bigger than Jan 6Up to this point, federal prosecutors had been accusing conspiracy defendants of aiming to block Congress\' vote to certify the election. But Thursday\'s case ups the ante, widening the conspiracy past January 6. The indictment says the Oath Keepers aimed for more than disruption of Congress. This group, prosecutors say, wanted to stop the transfer of presidential power from Trump to Joe Biden. After the insurrection, they gathered to celebrate, then continued talking.""We aren\'t quitting!! We are reloading!!,"" one of the defendants wrote in a Signal chat.In the week after the riot, Rhodes allegedly spent more than $17,500 on weapons, equipment, and ammunition. One member, according to the filings, said Rhodes should stay ""below the radar,"" while another brought what he called ""all available weapons"" to Rhodes\' home in Texas.Here\'s what \'insurrection,\' \'coup\' and \'sedition\' meanAround Inauguration Day, January 20, Rhodes allegedly told associates to organize local militias to oppose the Biden administration. Another member allegedly said, ""After this... if nothing happens...its war...Civil War 2.0.""""Rhodes and certain co-conspirators ... planned to stop the lawful transfer of presidential power by January 20, 2021, which included multiple ways to deploy force,"" the indictment says. Hunting for the bigger fish The Justice Department spent all of 2021 rounding up nearly two dozen alleged members of the Oath Keepers. They secured the cooperation of a few people charged in the original Oath Keepers conspiracy case -- the one without the sedition charges -- which was a significant breakthrough.Now we know that prosecutors were building a bigger case, and moving up the chain, to the leader of the extremist organization. Rhodes has previously denied any wrongdoing regarding January 6.Booking photo of Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes.From Collin County, TexasThe big question is: Is this the end of the road? Could Rhodes have information that implicates anyone else higher up? It has been widely reported that his organization was providing security for Trump surrogates like Roger Stone and Ali Alexander while they were in DC around January 6. A major criminal case obviously ramps up the pressure on people like Rhodes to cut a deal with prosecutors and become a government witness, if they have a story to tell.CNN\'s Katelyn Polantz, Evan Perez and Tierney Sneed contributed to this report.', '', 'Obamacare open enrollment ends Saturday as interest surgesBy Tami Luhby, CNNUpdated 7:00 AM ET, Fri January 14, 2022 JUST WATCHEDObamacare is on pace for record enrollment. Here\'s whyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHObamacare is on pace for record enrollment. Here\'s why 02:59 (CNN)Those interested in Affordable Care Act coverage for 2022 have until the end of Saturday to sign up in most states.Open enrollment, which lasted a month longer than under the Trump administration, ends January 15 in the 33 states that use the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, and in several states that run their own marketplaces. Certain states, such as New York and California, have extended the deadline by a few weeks. Idaho, on the other hand, ended its open enrollment in mid-December.Interest in Affordable Care Act coverage has surged, propelled by more generous federal subsidies that reduce premiums and out-of-pocket costs.Growing popularityRead MoreMore than 14.2 million people had signed up for coverage on the federal and state exchanges as of January 8 -- a record number for the 9-year-old program. That includes more than 10 million who have selected plans or were automatically reenrolled through healthcare.gov. A total of about 12 million people signed up during open enrollment for 2021 coverage.""Americans need, they want and they deserve quality, affordable health care,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, told reporters Thursday. ""Anyone who has ever lived without health coverage knows the peace of mind that comes from having access to care when you need it. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, they\'re getting it.""Obamacare is proving particularly popular in GOP-led states that have not expanded Medicaid to low-income adults, including Florida and Texas.The surge in interest in the Affordable Care Act comes as the Biden administration and the Democratic-led Congress have pumped more resources into the landmark health care law. The hefty enhancement of Obamacare\'s federal premium subsidies, part of the Democrats\' $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package enacted last March, is helping drive consumers to sign up for plans. This year, enrollees pay no more than 8.5% of their incomes toward coverage, down from nearly 10%. And lower-income policyholders receive subsidies that eliminate their premiums. Also, those earning more than 400% of the federal poverty level are now eligible for help for the first time.Four out of five consumers are finding plans for $10 or less a month, Becerra said. More than 90% of those on the federal exchange are getting financial assistance for coverage.But this generous aid expires after 2022, leading some consumers and experts to worry about what will happen next year, when premiums would likely rise. President Joe Biden\'s Build Back Better plan would extend the subsidies through 2025, but it remains stalled in the Senate.Beefing up marketing and outreachTo let Americans know about the extra assistance available now, the Biden administration has launched an extensive outreach and marketing campaign. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the federal exchange, is teaming up with local groups to spread the word and concentrating its media efforts on local markets. It has added six additional languages to its marketing campaign.The Biden administration is also pouring money into enrollment assistance -- which serves the dual purpose of reaching folks in local communities and helping them sign up for plans. The number of navigators has quadrupled to more than 1,500 this year, with assistance available in nearly every county served by the federal exchange.Special enrollment periodsThose who miss the deadline can still enroll in Affordable Care Act coverage throughout the year through a special enrollment period if they meet certain criteria, such as losing their jobs and work-based coverage, getting divorced or having children. The Biden administration has also made it easier to qualify for these special enrollment periods. Low-income folks can sign up if their premiums would be $0 after federal subsidies.Some 2.8 million people selected policies for 2021 coverage last year after Biden launched a six-month special enrollment period, which allowed the uninsured to sign up for policies and enrollees to take advantage of the enhanced subsidies.', 'China is still the ultimate prize that Western banks can\'t resistAnalysis by Laura He, CNN BusinessUpdated 5:41 AM ET, Fri January 14, 2022 JUST WATCHEDJamie Dimon on China joke: \'I regret and should not have made that comment\' ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH (16 Videos)Jamie Dimon on China joke: \'I regret and should not have made that comment\' \'It\'s insane\': Gas station owner reveals what inflation is doing to his businessIMF Director: Supply disruptions may continue into 2023ADP Economist: Higher wages aren\'t enough to bring workers backKey inflation measure hits 39-year highRestaurant owner who lost $2 million in weeks speaks outWarren uses \'econ 101\' to grill Jerome PowellWhy are people quitting their jobs?US economy added 199,000 jobs in DecemberInflation may stay high in 2022Manpower CEO: Employers are optimistic Economist predicts how Omicron will impact the economyCoal miners urge Manchin to reconsider Build Back BetterUS grapples with shortage of child care workersThe Federal Reserve signals rate hikes in 2022The child tax credit has supported these families.

Sign up here.Hong Kong (CNN Business)For many companies, doing business in China is getting trickier by the day. But Western banks and asset managers are more than willing to up their bets on the world\'s second biggest economy, convinced that the opportunities remain too good to pass up.Major banks in recent weeks have inked deals to expand their footprint in China — or are otherwise attempting to take greater control of their businesses there — after years of being forced to enter the market via joint ventures. That\'s despite fraught geopolitics, a slowing economy and an increasingly hostile environment for private business. Late last month, HSBC (HBCYF) received approval from Chinese regulators to take full control of its life insurance joint venture, which was created in 2009 in equal partnership with a Chinese company under rules that were rolled back in 2020. The bank said the move underscored its ""commitment to expanding business in China.""The British banking giant is also seeking a greater stake in HSBC Qianhai, its joint securities venture in China, according to Reuters, which cited an anonymous source. HSBC declined to comment to CNN Business. HSBC (HBCYF) isn\'t the only one. Wall Street A-listers such as BlackRock, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are already a few steps down that road. And the state-owned China Securities Journal reported Wednesday that Deutsche Bank (DB) wants to establish its own wealth management joint venture in the country. The German bank declined to comment.Goldman Sachs looks forward to a \'new chapter\' in ChinaRead More""The sheer size of China\'s virtually untapped equity and bond market is irresistible to the world\'s large financial institutions, especially since Beijing is finally allowing them to operate wholly owned mutual funds,"" said Alex Capri, a research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation.China is the world\'s second biggest market for stocks and bonds. But it\'s largely untapped by foreign investors: International holdings account for about 5% of the $14 trillion stock market, and less than 4% of the $17 trillion onshore bond market, according to stock exchange and central bank data.That started to change last year, after BlackRock (BLK) — the world\'s largest asset manager — in June became the first global firm to gain approval for a wholly owned Chinese mutual fund business. Two months later, BlackRock launched its first mutual fund in the country, and quickly raised $1 billion from more than 111,000 investors.Then, in August, JP Morgan (JPM) became the first US bank to gain full ownership of its securities unit. CEO Jamie Dimon said back then that China represents ""one of the largest opportunities in the world"" for the firm. In October, Goldman Sachs (GS), received the green light to fully take over its securities venture. And Morgan Stanley (MSPRE) followed suit with a victory of its own in December, when its Chinese partner said the American bank planned to boost its stake in a brokerage venture to 94%.More are coming. Earlier this week, China\'s securities regulator said it accepted an application from BNP Paribas (BNPQF) to establish a securities firm, bringing the company a step closer to broadening its presence in the country.""China represents a significant growth opportunity for global financial service companies,"" said Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer for KraneShares, an asset management firm focused on China stocks and bonds.""Developed markets such as the United States and Europe are highly competitive and mature which have led to fee compression and diminishing opportunities,"" he added. But ""China\'s markets are relatively young in comparison.""Expansion despite uncertaintyThe significant inroads for these banks are coming about two decades after China joined the World Trade Organization and promised to open up its financial sector.While progress was slow for a while, the country in 2019 announced that it would entirely remove foreign ownership limits for financial firms the following year, shortly after Chinese President Xi Jinping and former US President Donald Trump agreed to restart trade talks.The enthusiasm from global banks and asset managers also comes with risks, as there is growing uncertainty about China\'s political and regulatory climate — as well as Beijing\'s rising tensions with other countries.China\'s \'revolution\' cost investors $3 trillion. So why aren\'t they running scared?In late 2020, Beijing launched an unprecedented regulatory squeeze on private enterprise, worried that such firms had become too powerful. The ensuing crackdown has extended to major Chinese financial players like Ant Group, which was forced to overhaul its business and hew to strict regulations governing bank operations.""There is a sense, broadly, that Xi may moderate some of his more aggressive rhetoric after this year\'s 20th Party Congress, having assured his political position,"" said Craig Singleton, an adjunct China fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, referring to the widespread expectation that Xi will use an important political gathering to cement a historic third term in office. ""The biggest risk, however, is that he does the opposite.""A number of Western businesses have been swept up in controversy in China as geopolitical tensions worsen, especially over allegations of human rights violations in the country\'s western region of Xinjiang. In recent weeks, Walmart (WMT) and Intel (INTC) met public backlash in China over allegations that they were trying to avoid importing products sourced from Xinjiang. And last year, H&M, Nike (NKE) Adidas (ADDDF) and other Western retailers were threatened with a boycott in China because of the stand they had taken against the alleged use of forced labor to produce cotton in Xinjiang.Pressure at homeWestern companies are also facing pressures at home. Billionaire investor George Soros called BlackRock (BLK)\'s China investment a ""tragic mistake"" that could lose money for its clients and imperil US national security. Some American politicians also called on Wall Street to stop ""enabling Communist China"" and take a tougher stance against Beijing.The squeeze has continued in recent weeks. Last month, US President Joe Biden signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, a law that bans imports from Xinjiang over concerns about forced labor. It sent a clear message that his administration and Congress are looking to ratchet up the pressure on Beijing.Doing business in China is difficult. A clash over human rights is making it harderChina\'s decision to let more foreign firms into the country is ""aimed at shoring up collateral damage in the international community,"" according to Capri, who added that allowing Western companies to take larger stakes in China also gives Beijing ""leverage"" over Washington and Brussels.""This will increase tensions between the big financial firms in the US and Europe, and their home governments,"" he said.The moneymaking potential in China seems to outweigh any political headaches, though.""While China is facing huge economic headwinds, the country has defied bearish predictions in the past,"" Singleton said, adding that Western banks have continued to generate billions of dollars in revenue from China, even with the recent regulatory crackdown.""In other words, Western banks are playing the long game under the guise of portfolio diversification,"" he added.China\'s motiveAnd even as Beijing tightens its grip over parts of its economy, there are reasons why the country is eager to open its financial industry to foreign investors.The government wants to utilize global expertise as it builds a strong and diverse financial service industry, which it needs to manage its looming demographic crisis. A rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce have increased the burden on the country\'s inadequate pension system, and put tremendous pressure on the government to provide enough financial resources for the elderly.Time is running out for China to prepare its economy for a \'great demographic unknown\'China\'s strict adherence to its ""zero Covid"" strategy and slow, self-isolation from much of the world hasn\'t been enough to throw the country off course, either. Last year, Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, repeatedly talked about the importance of opening up the financial service industry and drawing on global capital and financial expertise.""One of the Chinese Communist Party\'s key attributes has been its adaptability and its pragmatism,"" Singleton said. He added that China understands it needs to maintain access to foreign markets, technology and capital, necessitating those continued partnerships with Western firms.""In other words, the CCP must integrate to survive, which means that it cannot completely eschew existing global norms or systems even as it tries to alter them to suit Beijing\'s needs,"" Singleton said.']","['Here\'s what Joe Biden can -- and can\'t -- do to fight inflationBy Kevin Liptak and Matt Egan, CNNUpdated 11:58 AM ET, Wed January 12, 2022 JUST WATCHEDBiden backs away from claims that inflation is \'temporary\' as prices in America surge more than they have in 30 yearsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBiden backs away from claims that inflation is \'temporary\' as prices in America surge more than they have in 30 years 04:39 (CNN)Soaring inflation has become a political liability for President Joe Biden, who has shifted his public message to acknowledging the problem and commiserating with Americans over higher prices.On Wednesday, a government report showed a key measure of inflation climbed to a level not seen since June 1982. Consumer price inflation rose by 6.8% without seasonal adjustments over the 12 months that ended in November, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.Stripping out food and energy, the prices of which tend to be more volatile, inflation rose 4.9% over the same period — the highest level since June 1991.Even as his administration scrambles to pull all available levers to bring prices down, there remains little that Biden -- or any president -- can do unilaterally to tame inflation in the short term. Yet there are policies Biden could advocate for that may eventually ease inflationary pressures. Republicans are eager to tie the problem to Biden\'s major government spending plans, which the White House insists will actually help ease inflationary concerns over time.Read MoreBut without many tools to directly tackle higher prices, the administration is looking to address some of the causes for inflation, like supply chain bottlenecks and shortages of goods. Even administration officials acknowledge it will take time for the effects of that strategy to be felt by consumers.What\'s the problem? The coronavirus pandemic warped global supply and demand patterns, causing a mismatch that has driven prices higher. Bringing an end to the pandemic will help return those patterns to normal. The steps Biden is taking now could have a limited effect but won\'t be felt for some time.Unclog the supply chainDisruptions in the global supply chain due to labor shortages, Covid-19 restrictions and an increased demand for goods (as opposed to services) have caused the prices of some products to increase.There are some signs that supply chain bottlenecks are improving, but the situation hasn\'t returned to pre-pandemic normal.The most visible steps Biden has taken so far to bring those prices down are to try unclogging bottlenecks at US ports, where container ships are waiting to unload. He announced last year that two of the largest US ports -- Los Angeles and Long Beach -- would operate 24 hours a day. And Biden announced in Baltimore in November new funding for expanding port capacity across the country.Once goods get offloaded, however, there is a shortage of truck drivers to transport them around the country. The administration is weighing steps like lowering the minimum age for truck drivers or trying to increase their pay to attract more drivers. And officials have not ruled out using the National Guard to step in and begin trucking goods.""Focusing on ports and supply chains is the right thing to do,"" Jason Furman, a top economic adviser to former President Barack Obama, told CNN. ""I don\'t know how much it all adds up to. I suspect not a lot, but it\'s worth trying.""Administration officials acknowledge that, even with these steps, any resulting decrease in prices will take time to materialize.""There is no quick fix. If there were a light switch, we would do that,"" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on CNN. ""We all have to be just a little bit patient because we are seeing that the action we are taking is working. We just have to stick with it, you know, long enough to solve the problem.""Address the worker shortage via immigrationOne of the driving forces behind inflation is the shortage of workers. The United States has a near-record number of job openings, and a staggering number of Americans are quitting their jobs. And yet immigration has fallen sharply in recent years amid the pandemic and tougher immigration policies during the Trump administration. Comprehensive immigration reform, which Biden could forcefully advocate for, would help ease the shortage of workers and thus the inflationary pressures, economists say. ""We have a lot of job openings. This is not going to threaten people here in America. In fact, it would help them,"" said Furman, who is now a professor at Harvard University. Address the spike in energy prices  As the global economy rebounds from the pandemic, the price of crude oil skyrocketed -- contributing to inflation. High gas prices are one of the most frustrating phenomena for any White House because they affect almost every American but they are mostly immune from presidential action. The White House announced in November the US would join India, Japan and South Korea in the first coordinated emergency oil release in a decade. The Department of Energy said it would release 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the stockpile of 600 million barrels of crude oil stored in underground salt caverns in Louisiana and Texas. While gas prices have dipped somewhat, that relief has leveled off -- and the price of oil is starting to rise again.Previously, Biden had blamed OPEC for high gas prices and called on the group of oil-producing nations to increase supply. A group of Democratic senators also asked Biden to ban oil exports to increase domestic supply. But that has the potential to anger both US producers and foreign allies. And some industry experts argue it would backfire because US gasoline is priced off Brent crude, the global benchmark. Eliminating US barrels would only drive Brent, and thus gas prices, higher.Engage the private sector Without many concrete policy levers to bring prices down, Biden has sought to use his presidential pulpit to engage industry leaders on the issue. He has spoken frequently with the CEOs of four major retailers and shippers -- Walmart, UPS, FedEx and Target -- about supply chain disruptions, and heard about their companies\' efforts to speed up deliveries.Pass his agenda In Biden\'s view -- and the view of some leading economists -- passing the second of the two sweeping spending bills that comprise much of his domestic agenda would help bring down inflation.""Build Back Better is critical to reining in the cost of living, particularly for lower and middle-income families,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\'s Analytics. Biden insists the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which he signed in November, will eventually ease backlogs at ports and improve the movement of goods, all while adding good-paying jobs. But those effects could potentially take years. The White House has been vague on when new infrastructure projects will begin after Biden signs the bill.Measures in the second social spending plan, like childcare subsidies and lowering prescription drug prices, would ease some financial burdens. But that bill appears stalled for now after Sen. Joe Manchin, the centrist West Virginia Democrat, said he couldn\'t support it. Among Manchin\'s concerns are the potential for the package to aggravate inflation.Ease tariffs One move Biden could make to help relieve the stress the pandemic-related supply chain crisis is having on US companies: Lift tariffs imposed by former President Donald Trump. Trump put tariffs on roughly $350 billion of Chinese-made goods -- and despite the change in administrations, those duties remain in place. American importers have paid more than $106 billion to cover the cost of those levies to date, and many of them are now facing skyrocketing shipping costs. While the Biden administration has been conducting a comprehensive review of the US-China trade policy, it has said little about restarting trade talks or lifting punitive duties.When he was in Europe last year, Biden did announce he was easing tariffs on European steel and aluminum, which officials said would lower costs on cars and other consumer goods and help speed up supply chains.""Why don\'t we try free trade? Get rid of tariffs. That would not only reduce prices but lubricate international trade,"" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. Increasing competition, fighting price fixing The price of meat has caused some of the biggest sticker shock in recent months. The Biden administration has sought to rein in prices by adopting a tougher stance on price fixing -- both on food and in the energy sector where gas prices have skyrocketed -- and to encourage more competition among processors. The White House announced this month it would allocate $1 billion in funding from the American Rescue Plan to independent meat and poultry producers as part of an effort to boost competition in the meat-processing industry and lower prices for consumers.And the President signed an executive order in September directing rule-making at the Agriculture Department to boost competition and improve conditions for smaller farmers. The White House has tasked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate potential price fixing in the energy sector.The White House has said consolidation in the meat sector is part of what has driven up prices. Some economists say more aggressively pushing antitrust laws could help ease inflation concerns.""One of the big puzzles today is that corporate profits are at record highs and yet the corporations are passing on all these price increases to consumers,"" said Robert Reich, who was Labor Secretary under former President Bill Clinton. ""If they were really in a competitive market, if we were not dealing with monopolies or what we call oligopolies, these companies would not so easily just simply pass these prices on to consumers. They\'d be worried about their competitors. But they\'re not and I think antitrust enforcement has got to go after these sources of huge market power, this corporate market power in the United States right now.""Push domestic production A global shortage of semiconductors -- the computer chips used in electronics and cars -- has prompted an increase in prices of those products, and a reckoning at how much the US depends on China for the technology. The chip shortage is hurting American consumers, with new vehicle prices climbing in October by the most since 1975.The Biden administration is seeking to invest in domestic production of semiconductors but is still waiting on Congress to act. The administration seeks to spend $52 billion on domestic semiconductor research and production in the bipartisan US Innovation and Competition Act, which has passed the Senate but still awaits action in the House.Of course, the additional supply of computer chips from these investments, if they get through Congress, would take considerable time for consumers feel. It takes years to build and fully scale up new semiconductor factories. Appoint a tough Fed chief Late last year, Biden nominated Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell to another four-year term to run the Fed -- a signal he wants continuity as the economy rebounds from the pandemic.In his confirmation hears in January, Powell pledged not to allow inflation to become ingrained in the American economy.""We know that high inflation exacts a toll, particularly for those less able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing and transportation,"" Powell said in his testimony submitted to Congress.It\'s important to emphasize that inflation falls under the purview of the Federal Reserve, not the White House. The Fed is charged with maintaining price stability and the recent period of elevated inflation is anything but stable. Nonetheless, the Fed continues to stimulate the economy, keeping interest rates at rock-bottom levels and only very recently moving to slow its bond buying program.""We put all of this on the President. We put him on a pedestal and pretend he has this power that he doesn\'t have,"" said JPMorgan\'s Kelly. ""This is the Federal Reserve\'s job.""As President, Biden does have power to advocate for sound policies that could address inflation and to convene industry leaders to tackle the underlying issues. ""The awkward fact is inflation is the job of the Fed,"" said Furman. ""Biden should be focused on other things. That\'s not great political advice because people are upset about inflation, and they want the president to solve their problems. But the truth is, it isn\'t his problem to solve.""End the pandemic Ultimately, what prompted high inflation is what will end it: The Covid-19 pandemic. When demand for services returns, workers return to the jobs market, and production of goods ramps back up, some of the factors driving up prices will ease.""I know it seems weird, but we\'ve got to get control of the spread of the virus so that people can go back to spending their money on services and there will be less emphasis in demand for physical goods and cars and computers and all of the stuff that are experiencing the supply shortages,"" said Austan Goolsbee, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Barack Obama.The fallout from the Omicron variant, which further scrambled supply chains and labor markets, underscores the role the health crisis continues to have on prices.""You\'re not going to get inflation down,"" said Zandi, ""unless you quell the pandemic.""This story has been updated with additional developments and reporting.', '', '', 'Is there a version of Biden\'s economic plan that Joe Manchin can support?Analysis by John Harwood, CNNUpdated 5:58 PM ET, Sun January 9, 2022 JUST WATCHEDDead or alive? A look at the status of Biden\'s Build Back Better billReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDead or alive? A look at the status of Biden\'s Build Back Better bill 13:30 (CNN)In 2009, Senate Democrats spent months courting Republican Charles Grassley in search of bipartisan support for the Affordable Care Act. By that September, President Barack Obama had lost patience.""Let me ask you a question, Chuck,"" Obama said in an Oval Office meeting he recounted in his 2020 memoir. ""Are there any changes -- any at all -- that would get us your vote?""""I guess not, Mr. President,"" Grassley replied, concluding negotiations.Is Sen. Joe Manchin now reprising Grassley\'s role on President Joe Biden\'s Build Back Better plan? If so -- if nothing can ultimately get the West Virginia Democrat to ""yes"" -- then more wheedling represents a waste of time. The legislation cannot pass without him.But the White House and party leaders, believing they cannot afford to fail, maintain hope that Manchin\'s vote can be won. That means exploring ways to reshape Biden\'s plan to meet the senator\'s objections.How months of talks between Biden and Manchin over Build Back Better broke down Read MoreIn theory, that shouldn\'t be so hard.Like the President, Manchin agrees an acceptable package could spend $1.75 trillion over 10 years. Before his bombshell pre-Christmas announcement of opposition to the House-passed version of the massive tax and spending bill that would expand the nation\'s social safety net, he had handed Biden a $1.8 trillion version.That\'s roughly half the President\'s original proposal, but other congressional Democrats have made clear they can accept that reduction. The challenge is determining how to spend it.As they whittled the price tag last year, House Democrats decided against culling many programs from Build Back Better. Instead, they financed them for only part of the 10-year span used in budget legislation, figuring a later Congress wouldn\'t let the money run out. Manchin complains that ""gimmick"" obscures the plan\'s true long-term cost. He\'d rather discard some proposals and fully fund those that remain. Sen. Joe Manchin speaks to reporters outside his office on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, January 4, 2022. That would inflict pain on Democratic union and social service constituencies that yearn for more money. Yet $1.75 trillion could still finance major priorities Democrats appear to agree on. Championing his coal-producing state, Manchin slams as unduly punitive some Build Back Better proposals to ameliorate climate change. But he insists he supports most of the bill\'s climate provisions. Overall, they cost $550 billion.Manchin also backs new subsidies to help parents obtain child care and prekindergarten education for 3- and 4-year-olds. Permanent funding for those parts of Build Back Better, the Congressional Budget Office estimates, takes $752 billion. Nor has Manchin objected to more financial help for Americans seeking health insurance under the Affordable Care Act (which Congress finally enacted in March 2010 without Grassley\'s support). Permanent funding for those Build Back Better provisions, CBO says, would cost $428 billion.A bill with those elements -- on climate change, child care, prekindergarten and Obamacare -- would represent a major advance for Democratic priorities. And the cumulative $1.73 trillion cost would fit Manchin\'s compromise budget.\'I\'m kind of speechless\': Democrats scramble to salvage climate provisions after Manchin sinks Build Back BetterOf course, that list omits hundreds of billions\' worth of other Biden proposals, including money to expand the housing supply, raise home health care workers\' pay, add hearing benefits under Medicare and augment the Earned Income Tax Credit for childless adults.More politically precarious, it also omits the Build Back Better provision many Democrats value most: an expanded Child Tax Credit that analysts say reduces childhood poverty by 40%. Manchin says too much of the money -- more than $1 trillion over 10 years if funded permanently -- would be squandered by undeserving recipients.Yet just a tiny fraction of that investment would deliver much of the benefit Democrats seek.For $50 billion over 10 years, the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities projects, Congress could cut child poverty 20% without even increasing the maximum Child Tax Credit that this administration inherited from President Donald Trump. The reduction would come from making the pre-Biden credit ""fully refundable"" -- available even to parents who don\'t earn enough to generate federal income tax liabilities.That\'s something Manchin does oppose, insisting it gives some parents without jobs money to spend on drugs rather than their children. But if fellow Democrats could persuade him to compromise, adding Child Tax Credit refundability would partially address their priority while leaving the cost of a revised Biden plan below $1.8 trillion.10 things you didn\'t know are in the Democrats\' Build Back Better billManchin also fears Build Back Better spending would expand the budget deficit and exacerbate inflation. But deficit hawks at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget say Biden has specified more than $2 trillion in bona fide financing sources, while economists in both parties envision the bill having a negligible inflationary impact.In other words, a hypothetical package along these lines would seem to meet Manchin\'s concerns. The question is whether his stated objections can be taken at face value.In the 2020 election, Trump defeated Biden in West Virginia by 39 percentage points -- a larger margin than anywhere except Wyoming. With a coal-loving constituency like that, perhaps Manchin -- like Grassley on Obama\'s health care plan -- simply cannot bring himself to push Biden\'s economic and climate agenda over the finish line.That did not, however, stop him from joining the party-line vote to pass Biden\'s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan last March. The next few weeks will tell whether the White House and Democratic leaders can make it happen again.', 'Biden eulogizes Reid as \'one of the greatest Senate Majority Leaders in history\'By Dan Merica, Jeff Zeleny and Allie Malloy, CNNUpdated 6:19 PM ET, Sat January 8, 2022 JUST WATCHEDA look back on Harry Reid\'s career in the SenateReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHA look back on Harry Reid\'s career in the Senate 02:29Las Vegas (CNN)Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was remembered by a host of top Democratic politicians at his memorial service in Las Vegas on Saturday, with President Joe Biden hailing the Nevada Democrat as someone who ""would always have your back"" and former President Barack Obama recalling him as a fighter ""who did not give up.""Reid, the scrappy former Democratic Senate leader who spearheaded epic legislative battles throughout three decades in Congress, died in December at age 82 following a four-year battle with pancreatic cancer.His service honored his love of family, with all five of the late senator\'s children speaking; his love of Nevada, the state he helped put on the political map during his decades in office; and the central role he played in ushering in some of the most significant pieces of legislation of the last two decades.Obama cast Reid as the consummate pragmatist, someone willing to work ""with folks he didn\'t agree with or particularly like"" in order to get things done.

The US and Russia are set to meet on Monday for high-stakes talks aimed at averting a war, as Russia has continued to amass troops near Ukraine\'s borders. But the US officials said that if the talks fail and Russia does launch a new attack, the US will go straight for high-impact targets -- unlike in 2014, when the US initially responded to Russia\'s annexation of Crimea by targeting smaller Russian banks and lower-level military officials.The officials said that instead, the administration will adopt a ""start high, stay high"" approach in which the US, in coordination with allies, will target its financial system and sectors deemed critical to the Kremlin.The change in strategy is both a recognition that sanctions to date have not changed Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s behavior, and a reflection of Biden\'s own convictions. As vice president in 2014, Biden urged President Barack Obama to impose harsher sanctions on Russia and arm Ukraine. But he was ultimately overruled.Read MoreAs President, Biden has promised ""severe consequences"" on the Russian economy if Putin orders a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Sources familiar with the sanctions options said the administration is preparing a range of significant trade restrictions should Russia attack, including export control measures that could halt Russia\'s ability to import smartphones and key aircraft and automobile components.The restrictions could also hamper Russia\'s technological advancements, including in the defense and civil aviation sectors, the sources said. Through the Foreign-Produced Direct Product Rule that the US has also imposed against Chinese tech company Huawei, the Biden administration is weighing banning exports to Russia of microelectronics -- think computer chips -- designed with US software or produced using US equipment.Some Biden administration officials have in recent weeks warned of collateral economic damage from harsh sanctions and the risk of retaliatory Russian cyberattacks should the US follow through with the penalties. But others in the administration believe the tough sanctions being weighed would have a manageable impact on the US, and said the US is taking steps along with allies to mitigate any unwanted spillover effects.Missile deploymentsThe Biden administration is open to discussing missile deployments in Ukraine and Europe and the possibility of restricting US and NATO exercises during the upcoming talks as long as Russia makes ""reciprocal"" commitments, according to another senior administration official.The official noted Biden has told Putin that the US has no plans for offensive missile deployments in Ukraine. The US is also willing to discuss the future of some missile systems in Europe along the lines of the now-defunct Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.The official stressed, however, that the upcoming bilateral talks between Russian and American officials will not result in any immediate, concrete agreements and that officials will need to bring anything discussed back to Washington and confer on it with American allies in the region.""We\'re going into these meetings with a sense of realism, not a sense of optimism,"" the official said, noting that the US will not know until the talks get underway if Russia is prepared to negotiate ""seriously and in good faith.""This official highlighted that troop numbers or American/NATO\'s force posture in Europe are definitively not on the table in the upcoming talks; Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a tweet on Wednesday that force changes are not on the table.Kirby wrote: ""Can state unequivocally that we are NOT weighing cuts to troops in Europe or posture changes there. Also not looking at changing troop numbers in the Baltics and Poland.""The official also emphasized that the Kremlin\'s remarks during or after the meeting, or what is reported by state-run media in Russia, may not actually reflect what is accomplished in the room. ', 'Appeals court sees little urgency in speeding up challenge to Texas abortion ban after contentious hearingBy Tierney Sneed, CNNUpdated 6:45 PM ET, Fri January 7, 2022 JUST WATCHEDSupreme Court upholds TX abortion law, but says providers can sue ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSupreme Court upholds TX abortion law, but says providers can sue  02:28 (CNN)In a tense hearing Friday, the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals signaled that -- for now -- it was likely to keep the Texas abortion case out of the hands of a federal judge who in the past had blocked the state\'s six-week ban on abortion. The 5th Circuit panel is deciding what should come next in abortion clinics\' federal lawsuit challenging the ban after the Supreme Court kept the case alive in a decision handed down last month. ""Maybe we should just sit on this until the end of June,"" Judge Edith Jones said Friday, citing a separate challenge to Roe v. Wade already at the high court.""By that time, it is very possible the hot potato will be in the seat of the Supreme Court,"" she added. The clinics say the case should be sent to US District Court Judge Robert Pitman, who blocked the law last October in a separate case brought by the Justice Department, only for that order to be frozen by the 5th Circuit. Read MoreThe providers\' request got no apparent traction with two of the three judges on the appellate panel. The third judge -- the panel\'s sole Democratic appointee -- had already said he would grant the request in a dissent that decried the ""impermissible delay to the vindication of the constitutional rights of Texas women in federal court."" Instead, the appellate panel\'s Republican-appointed majority seems poised to grant a request from Texas and the ban\'s other legal defenders to send the case to the Texas Supreme Court. The defenders say that, before the federal lawsuit moves any further, the Texas Supreme Court needs to weigh in on state law questions that they say were left unresolved by the US Supreme Court\'s decision last month. Jones, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, appeared to agree. She warned that the federal courts are ""all going to have egg on our faces"" if the Texas State Supreme Court interpreted the state law in a way that was at odds with how the federal judges were approaching the case. She also floated the idea that the 5th Circuit could just sit on the case until the US Supreme Court handed down its decision in a separate abortion case it heard last month, where the conservative justices may make significant changes to the court precedent that protects abortion rights. Circuit Judge Kyle Duncan, an appointee of President Donald Trump, meanwhile questioned whether there was really any urgency in moving the federal lawsuit along, given the ways the US Supreme Court had already scaled back the clinics\' case.Four months and counting that most abortions have been illegal in Texas The legal issues before the 5th Circuit are extremely technical. But at stake is whether abortion providers will have any shot in the coming months to get an order that would at least partially block enforcement of the law.  The clinics have already asked the Supreme Court to intervene yet again in the 5th Circuit\'s handling of the case. So far, the justices have not taken any action on that request, which was filed Monday night. The year Supreme Court conservatives made their mark  For more than four months, a law that bans a majority of abortions in the country\'s second most populous state has been in effect. Given the legal risks that come with violating the ban, which outlaws abortions when fetal cardiac activity is detected, clinics have been unwilling to offer the procedure in those instances -- a point around six weeks into the pregnancy, before many women even realize they\'re pregnant. So far, the Texas ban\'s unique enforcement mechanism has allowed it to stand in the face of Supreme Court precedent that protects abortion rights before a fetus is viable -- a point around 23 weeks into the pregnancy when the fetus can survive outside the womb. Rather than impose criminal or administrative penalties for clinics that conduct abortions after six weeks, the Texas law allows private citizens to sue those providers -- or anyone else who assists the person obtaining the abortion -- in state court, with the threat of damages of at least $10,000.When the US Supreme Court reviewed the case last year, it said the clinics could not get federal court orders preemptively blocking state court officials from accepting those lawsuits. But eight of the justices said their lawsuit could proceed against a select group of state licensing who could in theory revoke providers\' medical licenses for violating the six-week ban. On Friday, comments from Duncan illuminated why the Supreme Court decision had left clinics with little hope for effective relief in federal court from the law, known as SB8. ""The principal injury that you\'re seeking to redress here is the threat of SB8 lawsuits puts a chill on your clients\' provision of abortion services, right?"" Duncan told Marc Hearron, a senior counsel for the Center for Reproductive Rights who is representing the providers.""So how would an injunction against these licensing officials redress that at all?"" Duncan asked, later adding that, given that reality, he was struggling to see the urgency of moving the federal lawsuit along quickly. A clock ticking on a separate Supreme Court case that could bolster Texas\' ban In the background of these procedural maneuverings is an even bigger threat to abortion rights not just in Texas -- but nationwide. Gorsuch deals abortion providers another setback by sending Texas SB8 lawsuit to a conservative appeals courtThe Supreme Court last month heard a separate abortion case out of Mississippi that gives the conservative majority the opportunity to gut -- and perhaps, outright reverse -- current precedent protecting pre-viability abortions.The idea of waiting until a summer ruling on the Mississippi case and Roe v. Wade drew vehement pushback from the clinics\' attorney, who called it ""completely inconsistent"" with how quickly the Supreme Court handled had the Texas case so far. Even the attorney for Texas, Assistant Solicitor General Natalie Thompson acknowledged that Texas is not asking for that delay, under persistent grilling from Judge Stephen Higginson, who was appointed by President Barack Obama. Nerves were frayed among the judges as the 45-minute hearing wore on. Not only did the Republican-appointed judges express repeated dissatisfaction with how Hearron, the clinics\' attorney, was handling their questions, they exchanged shots with Higginson. Jones interjected in one line of tough questions Higginson had for Texas\' attorney: ""Normally this court isn\'t litigating on behalf of on one side or the other,"" Jones said.Higginson asked Thompson, the Texas attorney, if there had be any unfair question to her. She said no and he continued with his questions.', 'Harris\' new communications director apologizes for tweets on \'undocumented folks\'By Jasmine Wright, CNNUpdated 5:01 PM ET, Fri January 7, 2022 Jamal Simmons speaks on stage at the Elections 2016: The Wild Ride to the White House panel on September 27, 2016, in New York City.  (CNN)Vice President Kamala Harris\' newly announced communications director Jamal Simmons is apologizing for decade-old tweets on ""undocumented folks"" that resurfaced after news of his appointment.A trio of tweets from November 2010 got renewed attention in the day since Simmons\' hiring was reported. In one, he wrote, ""Just saw 2 undocumented folks talking on MSNBC. One Law student the other a protester. Can someone explain why ICE is not picking them up?."" Minutes later, he responded to a user saying he was ""not mixing anything or suggesting ICE shld pick them up. Just seems odd u can go on TV & admit breaking law & not be arrested.""And, in what appears to be an attempt to do clean up, Simmons tweeted again that same day, ""I\'ll try this again: Just saw 2 undocumented folks talking on MSNBC and have serious legal question. Why wouldn\'t ICE pick them up.""In a statement obtained by CNN, Simmons wrote, ""As a pundit for much of my career I have tweeted a lot and spoken out on public issues. Sometimes I have been sarcastic, unclear, or just plainly missed the mark. I sincerely apologize for offending those who care as much as I do about making America the best, multi-ethnic, diverse democracy it can be. I know the role I am taking on is to represent the Biden-Harris administration, and I will do so with humility, sincerity and respect.""In a tweet later Friday, Simmons wrote: ""For the record, I\'ve never advocated for, nor believed that Dreamers should be targeted by ICE agents. I\'ve been for DACA + comprehensive immigration reform for years. Frankly, it\'s depressing ppl can forget about every other thing I\'ve said in public on this bc of bad tweets.""Read MoreHarris, Simmons\' new boss, leads the administration\'s diplomatic efforts in stemming the flow of migration from the Northern Triangle and she\'s faced scrutiny and criticism in her role, including from Republicans who have sought to cast her as the face of the Biden administration\'s politically perilous immigration issues. She has also faced criticism from progressive immigration activists who say the administration has not done enough to unwind former President Donald Trump\'s immigration policies after about a year in office.News of Simmons\' hire was the first of what is expected to be a communications overhaul of sorts for the vice president, who spent her first year in office in defense mode following a myriad of reports, including by CNN, of staff infighting and dysfunction. It\'s yet another tough break for a vice president who has been shadowed by communications issues throughout her first year in office.Simmons, according to various biographies, has worked in politics and media for more than two decades, helping elect former Democratic presidents like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama as well as appearing on CNN, NPR, MSNBC and CBS among others.This story has been updated with an additional comment from Simmons.CNN\'s Shawna Mizelle contributed to this report.', 'Actor Sidney Poitier stars in ""Buck and the Preacher,"" a film that he also directed in 1972.

(CNN)On January 6, I woke up knowing it was going to be a difficult day, but I had no idea that it would take the harrowing turn that it did.  In fact, I was actually somewhat optimistic when the day began. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, hours before, had won their US Senate runoffs in Georgia, giving Democrats control of the Senate. Weeks earlier in November, in Texas and throughout the country, turnout in the 2020 presidential election had been historic -- with people of all backgrounds and political persuasions making their voices heard despite fearmongering and misinformation.  Then that day, as expected, President Donald Trump\'s allies Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas objected to the Arizona results -- attempting to prop up the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. Read More That\'s when I started getting texts from friends and family asking where I was, and if I was safe. A violent mob of Trump supporters was descending on the US Capitol. I texted my wife, ""Whatever happens, I love you."" I was prepared for the worst.  Many people don\'t know just how close we came to a more catastrophic event with even further loss of life. Thanks to the bravery of US Capitol Police and DC Metro Police, my colleagues and I were safely evacuated. I will be forever grateful for the service of these officers. I believe that the most important thing that happened that day is not a failed attempt to reject the results of a free, fair and secure election, but Congress acting in a strong bipartisan fashion to reaffirm our democracy later that night. Democracy held, but it showed dangerous signs of fracturing.  What the January 6 report means for the future of democracy As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I have spoken with representatives from allied nations since that day. As the world watched the attempted coup, many wondered whether democracy in the US would survive.  The events of January 6 fit into a broader authoritarian movement across the world, which is attempting to undermine and weaken western democracies. Powerful autocracies like Russia and China continue to crack down on democratic movements at home and to export anti-democratic propaganda and technology abroad, while former secular democracies like Hungary, Turkey and Poland continue to experience democratic backsliding.  And now the US joins that list of democracies in decline, according to European think tank International IDEA.  We\'ve seen this before. In the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, authoritarian movements swept the most powerful countries in the world, from Germany to Italy, Spain to Japan -- and it was the United States which helped to lead the world in an effort to defeat these movements.  Once again, the United States must lead the way out of this new era of authoritarianism.The battle that will define America in 2022 began in 1865 To Democrats, guaranteeing voting rights is a critical part of safeguarding democracy. However, we also recognize that our efforts to do so will not succeed without support from Republicans and Independents alike.  2022 is the year that the pro-democracy forces that believe in this country -- regardless of party affiliation -- must come together to act. Like Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a Republican member of the January 6 House select committee, other Republicans must be willing to reject Trump\'s toxic brand of politics and stand up for democratic principles.  Accountability for January 6, though important, isn\'t enough. As we saw in Texas and other states Republican-controlled legislatures were all too willing to go along with the ""Big Lie"" and make it harder for many Americans to cast their ballot.  As former President George W. Bush said in a September speech marking the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, ""There is little cultural overlap between violent extremists abroad and those at home. But in their disdain for pluralism, in their disregard for human life, in their determination to defile national symbols, they are children of the same foul spirit, and it is our duty to confront them."" It was under Bush that the Voting Rights Act was last reauthorized in 2006 with near-unanimous bipartisan approval in the House and Senate.

The House is ready to act, as we did with the John Lewis Voting Rights Act last summer. Despite hurdles within the Senate to changing the filibuster, the Senate must use any and all options it can to get this done. This bill is too important to let an arcane Senate rule stop the work we need to do.   Our democracy is at stake. Let\'s fight to protect it, together.

(Photo by Scott Cunningham/Getty Images) (CNN)Former President Jimmy Carter warned Wednesday that democracy is being threatened throughout the country, cautioning that ""our great nation now teeters on the brink of a widening abyss."" Carter, writing in a New York Times op-ed published on the eve of the anniversary of the January 6 insurrection, charged that ""without immediate action, we are at genuine risk of civil conflict and losing our precious democracy.""""Americans,"" the 97-year-old former President said, ""must set aside differences and work together before it is too late.""A year ago, the Democrat had joined the three other living former Presidents -- Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton -- in deriding the violent rioters who stormed the Capitol as Congress met to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election for President Joe Biden. On Wednesday, Carter wrote that ""promoters of the lie that the election was stolen have taken over one political party and stoked distrust in our electoral systems.""Fact check: Five enduring lies about the Capitol insurrectionCarter said he had hope that the deadly attack on the Capitol ""would shock the nation into addressing the toxic polarization that threatens our democracy.""Read MoreBut politicians, he said, ""have leveraged the distrust they have created to enact laws that empower partisan legislatures to intervene in election processes"" and ""seek to win by any means, and many Americans are being persuaded to think and act likewise, threatening to collapse the foundations of our security and democracy with breathtaking speed.""""I now fear that what we have fought so hard to achieve globally -- the right to free, fair elections, unhindered by strongman politicians who seek nothing more than to grow their own power -- has become dangerously fragile at home,"" said Carter, who in his post-presidency started the Carter Center, a nonprofit that monitors free elections around the globe.The former President offered five points to secure elections in the United States: American citizens must agree on constitutional norms and respect each other despite political differences; the country should push for election reforms to ensure access to and confidence in elections; the country should resist polarization; the country should reject violence in politics; and lastly, disinformation must be addressed.""For American democracy to endure, we must demand that our leaders and candidates uphold the ideals of freedom and adhere to high standards of conduct,"" he said.', '', '', 'The question the GOP must answer about January 6Opinion By Dean ObeidallahUpdated 9:51 PM ET, Sun January 2, 2022 JUST WATCHEDStelter: The story of January 6 keeps getting biggerReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH (17 Videos)Stelter: The story of January 6 keeps getting bigger\'Shameless\': Avlon reacts to McCarthy\'s press conferenceSee the messages Oath Keepers leader sent to followersDOJ files rarely-used \'seditious conspiracy\' charges against January 6 defendants Why the Supreme Court decided against vaccine mandateHear why Sinema is concerned about eliminating filibusterThe case against a 2024 Hillary Clinton candidacy Senator says he\'s \'glad\' Biden went a \'little too far\' in voting rights speechHear how McCarthy\'s words on 1/6 have changed in a year\'Extraordinarily painful to watch\': GOP senator under fire for remarks about Black judicial nomineeEfforts to reform 19th century law could decide who is president in 2024Lindsey Graham picks side in Trump vs. McConnell divideCNN reporter explains what GOP is plotting if they win majority\'It looks bleak, honestly\': Gloria Borger on Biden\'s push to pass voting rights billsFauci calls Republican senator a \'moron\' under his breath during tense hearingReporter explains why McConnell isn\'t talking about TrumpTrump attacks McConnell in new interviewDean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio\'s daily program ""The Dean Obeidallah Show"" and a columnist for The Daily Beast. Follow him @DeanObeidallah. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. This piece has been updated to reflect the latest news. (CNN)In the weeks after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, then-President George W. Bush famously stood before a joint session of Congress and declared to the nations of the world: ""Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists."" As we approach the one-year anniversary of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, that is the very question we all should pose to any GOP elected official who still downplays the assault or supports the election lie that led to the violence: Do they stand with the United States, or do they stand with the terrorists? Dean ObeidallahTo be clear, framing the question to include the word ""terrorists"" is accurate, given that FBI Director Christopher Wray described the Capitol riot as ""domestic terrorism"" in Senate testimony. The federal statute defining domestic terrorism also backs this up, since the events of January 6 involved ""acts dangerous to human life"" that were intended ""to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion."" Yet there are GOP elected officials who have downplayed and attempted to whitewash the insurrection -- for example, Rep. Andrew Clyde astoundingly likened the assault we saw on January 6 to ""a normal tourist visit"" in the Capitol. Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, the chair of the House committee investigating the Capitol riot, stated on ""Meet The Press"" on Sunday that the panel is working to determine whether any members of Congress ""assisted"" in any way in the attack. If any of the GOP representatives attempting to rewrite history are ultimately compelled to testify, the first question that should be asked of them is this: ""Are you with us or with the terrorists?"" January 6 was a test the US keeps failingIn fact, when you look at the details surrounding the riot and the role former President Donald Trump played in how it unfolded, I\'d submit that anyone still supporting Trump needs to be asked point blank whose side they\'re on. This is especially true after GOP Rep. Liz Cheney confirmed Sunday that the House committee investigating the attack has ""firsthand testimony"" that Trump ""was sitting in the dining room next to the Oval Office watching the attack on television"" and did nothing to end it. As Cheney explained, even ""his daughter Ivanka went in at least twice to ask him to please stop this violence,"" yet he chose not to act.As a reminder, Trump had very publicly called his loyal fans to be in Washington, DC, on January 6, promising them it would be ""wild."" And on that fateful day when thousands gathered and chanted ""Fight for Trump,"" he told them, ""We\'re going to walk down to the Capitol,"" falsely promising that he would be there with them. Trump worked the crowd into a fever pitch with lines like, ""You will have an illegitimate president. That\'s what you\'ll have. And we can\'t let that happen,"" a sentiment he echoed in the speech more than once.Read MoreWatch out for 2022 -- Trump isn\'t finished just yetWe all saw the attack on our Capitol that followed. People dressed in Trump campaign paraphernalia -- some wielding pepper spray, armed with bats and other weapons -- laid siege to our Capitol, with some attacking police officers and causing severe injuries. The DOJ has since charged more than 725 people in connection with the insurrection. And despite lies by GOP elected officials such as Sen. Ron Johnson, who claimed that ""by and large it was peaceful protest,"" more than 75 individuals have been charged with ""using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer."" Add to that, some of the January 6 attackers were carrying firearms with them when they were arrested -- while prosecutors have alleged that others had guns stashed nearby. But perhaps even more alarming than the distortions of some GOP leaders is a new CBS poll finding many Republicans view the January 6 attack in a positive light. While more than half of all Americans view the actions of the January 6 attackers as an effort ""to overturn the election,"" the poll found, 56% of Republicans responded that the riot was an act ""defending freedom."" And while only 26% of Americans overall said they view the attackers\' actions as ""patriotism,"" when broken down by party nearly 50% of Republicans said they do. Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion\'s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookThink about that for a moment. The majority of Republicans polled saw the January 6 attack that left more than 100 police offers injured, members of Congress hiding in fear and our Capitol desecrated -- all predicated on Trump\'s bald-faced lie about 2020 election fraud -- as an act of ""patriotism"" and ""defending freedom."" Some Democratic officials are now debating whether it\'s savvy politics to talk about the January 6 attack and the threat this version of the GOP poses to our democracy. Forget polling and political posturing. This is about saving our Republic. To that end, it\'s time Democrats press the GOP to tell our fellow Americans whether they are with us or with the terrorists. We all deserve to know the answer to that question.', 'Former US Sen.

He attended high school in Henderson, Nevada, often hitchhiking the 45-mile route. A boxer in his youth, Reid later attended Utah State University before moving to Washington, DC, and working his way through law school at George Washington University by working as an officer for the United States Capitol Police.

Harry ReidReid acknowledges the audience during a Nevada Democrats event in Las Vegas in 2019. A year earlier, he underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer.Hide Caption 33 of 33After law school, Reid returned to Nevada and served as lieutenant governor from 1971 to 1975, the youngest person elected to that role in the state. After losing reelection, Reid served as chair of the Nevada Gaming Commission, a powerful position that oversees and regulates the state\'s casino industry. The job made Reid and his family a target of the mob: After he left that post, his wife found a bomb in the family\'s car, Reid wrote in his memoir. Reid\'s political career grew with Nevada. When the state went from one congressional district to two after the 1980 census, Reid ran for a newly created congressional district around Las Vegas in 1982 and won the general election. He was reelected in 1984. He then successfully ran for Nevada\'s open Senate seat in 1986.  He rose through the leadership ranks there, serving as the chamber\'s Democratic whip from 1999 to 2005. From 2005 through his retirement in 2017, he served as his party\'s leader in the Senate, through Democrats\' time in both the minority and the majority. Playing politics  As the chamber\'s Democratic leader, Reid was a polarizing figure. Republicans argued much of the congressional gridlock stemmed from his hard-ball tactics, but Reid often reveled in playing the political bad guy -- even calling then-President George W. Bush a ""loser"" and a ""liar."" (Later, when Donald Trump was in the White House, Reid told CNN\'s Bash that he wished for Bush ""every day."") Reid is often blamed for deepening an era of political polarization with irascible rhetoric about Republicans and the use of controversial Senate procedures that left traditionalists worried that the consensus that once made the chamber special had vanished forever.  He brought those same tactics to electoral politics, too. During Obama\'s reelection bid in 2012, Reid accused Republican nominee Mitt Romney, with no evidence, of not paying his taxes. Asked by CNN in 2015 whether he regretted the attack, Reid said, ""I don\'t regret that at all."" ""Romney didn\'t win, did he?"" Reid asked rhetorically. As much as he irked Republicans, he was often cheered by Democrats for being the last line of defense to Bush and other Republicans. He was a staunch defender of social programs and, reflecting wishes of the large Latino community back home, a proponent of immigration reform.  Reid shepherded the centerpieces of Obama\'s liberal political legacy into law, and he said one of his proudest accomplishments had been encouraging then-Sen. Obama to run for president.  ""I did call him into my office and told him he should take a look at it. And he was stunned because I was the first one that ever suggested that to him,"" Reid told CNN in 2015.  ""When he was reelected, (that was) one of the most moving phone calls I\'ve ever received because he said, you know, \'You\'re the reason I\'m here,\'"" Reid recalled. Obama reiterated that sentiment in the letter he sent to Reid released Tuesday evening. ""Here\'s what I want you to know. You were a great leader in the Senate, and early on you were more generous to me than I had any right to expect,"" Obama wrote.""As different as we are, I think we both saw something of ourselves in each other - a couple of outsiders who had defied the odds and knew how to take a punch and cared about the little guy. And you know what, we made for a pretty good team,"" he added.Former President Bill Clinton also lauded Reid, remembering him as ""one of the most effective Senate leaders our country has ever known.""""We will likely never see another public servant quite like him—in personality, command of strategy and tactics, and assuredness in marching to the beat of his own drum,"" Clinton said in a statement.In the darkest hours of the Great Recession, Reid ushered a nearly $800 billion economic stimulus plan through the Senate despite insurmountable rows with most Republicans, who said it was too expensive and racked up too much debt.  Later, he piloted the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, through the Senate using a controversial budget maneuver known as reconciliation to bypass a Republican filibuster, and he told the GOP to ""stop crying"" about it.  ""Senator Harry Reid was a leader of immense courage and ferocious conviction who worked tirelessly to achieve historic progress for the American people,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who, as the House\'s top Democrat for the last 20 years, worked with Reid across the Capitol. ""Over more than four decades of public service, Senator Reid was guided always by his North Star: to improve the lives of working families like his own,"" she added in a statement reflecting on his death. In modern-day Washington, the former senator\'s impact is perhaps most present in his 2013 change to the Senate rules to prevent filibusters of most executive branch nominations. He told CNN last year that he ""absolutely"" doesn\'t regret changing the rules at the time, saying: ""I have no regret. It was the right thing to do. And by the way, it\'s not the first time the rules have been changed. They\'ve been changed lots of times. It was time to do it again.""  Broad use of the filibuster has soared in recent years in an increasingly polarized Congress. The shift prompted Reid to pen an opinion piece in the New York Times in 2019 calling for an end to the filibuster altogether.  ""During the two decades we served together in the United States Senate, and the eight years we worked together while I served as Vice President, Harry met the marker for what I\'ve always believed is the most important thing by which you can measure a person—their action and their word,"" Biden said in his Tuesday statement.""If Harry said he would do something, he did it. If he gave you his word, you could bank on it. That\'s how he got things done for the good of the country for decades,"" the President added.Despite his blunt political style, Reid inspired fierce respect from many of his longtime aides, as well as fellow lawmakers -- even those across the aisle.  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who was frequently at odds with Reid during their lengthy careers, remembered him as a ""one-of-a-kind"" senator, saying their relationship had transcended political fights.""The nature of Harry\'s and my jobs brought us into frequent and sometimes intense conflict over politics and policy. But I never doubted that Harry was always doing what he earnestly, deeply felt was right for Nevada and our country,"" the Kentucky Republican said. ""He will rightly go down in history as a crucial, pivotal figure in the development and history of his beloved home state.""Reid told CNN earlier this year that he has ""a lot of respect"" for John Boehner, the former Republican House speaker from Ohio with whom he sparred for years, as he reacted to excerpts of Boehner\'s memoir and lambasted the Republican Party\'s more recent ""tribal"" turn.   ""The deal is this. John Boehner and I got a lot done, but we didn\'t mince words,"" he said.  Love and legacy Despite Reid\'s reputation as a hard bargainer with no qualms about scrapping with his opponents, he was also known as a romantic and the most influential person in his life was his wife, Landra. The two met in high school when Reid was 15. Her father was so opposed to the two dating that Reid and his would-be father-in-law got into a fist fight early in their courtship. Reid, who was raised agnostic, told Bash in 2015 that their opposition was that they wanted their daughter to marry someone Jewish. They eloped in 1959 during college, converting to Mormonism a year later. Her parents finally came around on him. ""I am a blessed man to have this 5-foot tall woman with me all these years,"" said Reid.  The former Senate majority leader credited one thing for his political success over the years: Hard work.  ""I didn\'t make it in life because of my athletic prowess. I didn\'t make it because of my good looks. I didn\'t make it because I\'m a genius,"" he said in his farewell address on the Senate floor in 2016. ""I made it because I worked hard.""  Reid\'s most lasting legacy is likely to be felt in Nevada, where the senator not only remade the Western state, but turned it into a Democratic stronghold that last backed a Republican president in 2004.  ""The little boy from Searchlight has been able to be part of a changing state of Nevada,"" he said in his farewell address in 2016. Reid was instrumental in pushing Democrats to make Nevada one of the first nominating contests in the country, a move that focused Democratic attention on Nevada and was a catalyst to its leftward shift. He often pushed Democrats to make Nevada even more important, urging the party, because of the state\'s diversity, to move the state before Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states in the nominating process. He also used his power to lift up the careers of younger politicians, like Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, whom the former Senate majority leader recruited to run for his seat when he was retiring in 2016.""Harry Reid was a champion for Nevada, helping preserve our precious environmental treasures, strengthen our rural communities, and build up our great cities,"" Cortez Masto recalled in a statement on Tuesday. ""The American people are better off because of the leadership of Senator Harry Reid.""In recognition of the impact Reid had on Nevada, the Clark County Board of Commissioners voted earlier this year in favor of renaming McCarran International Airport to Harry Reid International Airport. Reid reflected on his life -- and the role he played in changing Nevada -- when he received a lifetime achievement award from the Nevada Democratic Party in 2019. ""It\'s a long way from Searchlight to Washington,"" he said. ""But I didn\'t get there alone. I got there because of you, Nevadans."" This story has been updated with additional information.

A pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol that day, breaking windows and clashing with police officers. Trump supporters had gathered to protest the ratification of Joe Biden\'s Electoral College victory. (CNN)America\'s running political conversation defaults to the sitting president. Today, Joe Biden\'s legislative struggles, pandemic management and weak approval rating drown out most everything else. But in 2021, the performance of his partisan adversaries mattered at least as much to the nation\'s future. And in Washington and state capitals alike, Republicans have compiled a record of dishonesty and aggression that threatens American democracy itself.The January 6 insurrection, incited by then-President Donald Trump to overturn his election defeat, offered them a different path. Deadly violence that endangered their own lives gave Republican lawmakers the strongest possible justification for separating themselves from Trump\'s disfiguring pathologies.For a moment, they did. Shaken congressional leaders condemned him and returned to the vandalized capital to affirm Biden\'s victory.The moment passed.Read MoreState legislators gear up to pass a \'tidal wave\' of voting restrictions ahead of crucial 2022 midtermsThose same Republican leaders later scuttled a proposed bipartisan investigation. GOP legislators in battleground states curbed voting procedures and changed election administration to help future losers succeed where Trump had failed in thwarting the popular will. ""Until recently, when I got up in the morning it didn\'t occur to me that American democracy might be in the balance,"" observed Richard Haass, a high-ranking national security aide to two Republican administrations who has quit the GOP. ""It\'s no longer a given. I don\'t think it\'s melodramatic to say this is the greatest crisis we\'ve faced since the 19th century.""Narrowly, the crisis stems from Trump\'s 2016 rise on false promises to the minority of voters most aggrieved by the cultural and economic changes reshaping 21st-century America. But its roots extend back to the decades-old Republican strategy of harvesting support from conservative White opponents of the 1960s civil rights revolution.Those voters -- disproportionately Southern, less educated, rural, evangelical -- now represent the white-hot core of the Trump-era GOP.Analysis: There\'s nothing more frightening in America today than an angry White man""When you think about the DNA of the current Republican Party being built around racial resentment, it\'s only one small step,"" said Robert P. Jones, an opinion analyst who\'s the CEO and founder of Public Religion Research Institute. ""The very idea that some citizens ought to have a privileged place in the eyes of the law is, at its heart, anti-democratic.""Unlike earlier Republican campaigns, Trump barely masked his race-based appeals. He consistently stoked anxiety over lost power and primacy among the shrinking ranks of White conservative Christians.""Having alienated college-educated suburban voters, many consequential Republicans decided their best bet is to keep their contracting coalition in a state of constant agitation and fear, combatants in a never-ending culture war,"" Peter Wehner, a former aide to President George W. Bush, wrote earlier this year. ""Right now, the Republican Party is a grave threat to American democracy.""Trump has long expressed admiration for authoritarian strongmen. Fox News star Tucker Carlson in August staged his program in Hungary, the east European nation scholars call an exemplar of eroding democracy.Analysis: Why it\'s now \'American identity, stupid\' in US politics""There are two key metrics: how do they deal with violence, and do they accept election results,"" said Harvard professor Daniel Ziblatt, co-author of the book ""How Democracies Die."" On both counts, Republicans have crept toward authoritarianism.Trump and elected allies turned to praising the January 6 mob and minimizing its lawless violence; some brandish guns on social media or in campaign ads. One congressman circulated a photoshopped anime video that appeared to depict the murder of a Democratic colleague. (He later said he doesn\'t ""espouse violence or harm towards any member of Congress"" and that the video ""symbolizes the battle for the soul of America."")In a recent Public Religion Research Institute survey, 30% of Republicans agreed that ""true American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country."" In a differently worded American Enterprise Institute poll question last January, 60% of White evangelical Christians agreed that ""The traditional American way of life is disappearing so fast that we may have to use force to save it.""Egged on by Trump, leading Republicans have made affirming or acquiescing in his big lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him a threshold qualification. In the 2022 GOP primary race for Georgia governor, ex-Sen. David Perdue distinguishes himself from incumbent Brian Kemp by saying he would not have certified Biden\'s 2020 Georgia win.Deteriorating political conditions for Democrats have positioned Republicans to win control of Congress next year without extra help. But having lost the popular vote in seven of the last eight presidential elections, they\'re not taking chances.Vilified by Trump, Liz Cheney explores her political future with backing from GOP eldersA cadre of anti-Trump Republicans see glimpses of hope in their effort to change the party from within. Barbara Comstock, a former House member and congressional staffer, cites the Virginia gubernatorial victory in November of private-equity executive Glenn Youngkin, who accepted Trump\'s endorsement but eschewed his raw tactics.""Has it been a discouraging year? Yes,"" Comstock allowed. ""But I do feel new leaders will step up.""""It\'s important to wrench the party back to its senses,"" added Kori Schake, a former Bush aide who directs foreign policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. ""I do think it\'s possible. I\'m still a Republican, standing squarely behind Liz Cheney.""Invoking the Wyoming Republican congresswoman, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, only underscores the enormousness of the challenge. House Republicans ousted her as conference chair after she emphatically rejected Trump\'s election lies. She and Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois have become lone voices seeking to hold Trump and insurrectionist allies accountable and affirm America\'s 245-year-old democratic experiment.""How we address January 6 is the moral test of our generation,"" Cheney declared recently. In 2021, her party failed it.', 'Finding a Covid-19 test is a struggle right now in the US as Omicron and holiday plans collideBy Aya Elamroussi, CNNUpdated 3:23 AM ET, Thu December 23, 2021 JUST WATCHEDFauci weighs in on risk of indoor holiday gatherings ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH (18 Videos)Fauci weighs in on risk of indoor holiday gatherings Doctor says \'our empathy has taken a hard hit\' during covid surgeGuest corrects Joe Rogan live on his own show.

Paul in heated exchange (CNN)With coronavirus cases surging once again, frustrated Americans are struggling to get tested days before Christmas as long lines and increased demand overwhelm some facilities across the country.The catalyst has been the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, which has become the dominant strain in the US in a matter of weeks and has led to a slew of new measures to combat the spread.Omicron will not recognize state lines when it storms the US, expert saysWith millions traveling or planning to join large family gatherings, there is a rush to get tested -- and many people are running out of luck, either with getting tests at clinics or with buying at-home test kits.Long lines were seen this week in New York City, Boston and Miami, as well as Ohio and Minnesota. At the same time, CVS Health and Walgreens -- the two largest pharmaceutical chain stores in the US -- are limiting the number of at-home Covid kits customers can buy due to significant demand, they announced.Read MoreThe demand is only going to grow, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. ""We do have some testing. But what we\'re going to need, I think, over the course of the next two to eight weeks is going to be remarkable. We are going to see this big surge nationwide,"" he predicted.And while the Biden administration plans to provide 500 million new tests by next month, the holiday test surge is happening now. A former assistant secretary of the US Health and Human Services Department is concerned the co pledge on tests will not meet the demand, he said. ""Unless we have a billion or 2 billion a month, I think we\'re still going to have to be selective to make sure that we keep people who can die from the disease from dying from the disease,"" Adm. Dr. Brett Giroir told CNN.FDA authorizes first pill to treat Covid-19While experts urge more test availability, physicians are getting another tool to fight Covid-19: The US Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday authorized Pfizer\'s antiviral pill, Paxlovid, to treat the disease.This is the first antiviral Covid-19 pill authorized for ill people to take at home, before they get sick enough to be hospitalized. It\'s authorized for people age 12 and older who weigh at least 88 pounds.Paxlovid combines a new antiviral drug named nirmatrelvir and an older one called ritonavir. Pfizer last week released updated results that showed the treatment cut the risk of hospitalization or death by 89% if given to high-risk adults within a few days of their first symptoms. If given within the first five days of symptoms, the efficacy was similar: 88%.The authorization is an ""enormous step forward"" and ""another way we will be able to live with this disease going forward,"" said Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a former medical adviser in the George W. Bush administration and a professor of medicine and surgery at George Washington University, during a Wednesday appearance on CNN.On the issue of testing, Reiner says the issue is not just being able to order tests, but accessibility. He says Biden\'s announcement of a plan to acquire 500 million tests that Americans can order online is ""great but not enough. Tests need to be available everywhere you look: drug stores, gas stations, banks.""Covid-19 cases in the US are rising: The country averaged more than 148,000 new cases a day over the last week, 23% higher than a week ago and back to levels last seen in mid-September, according to Johns Hopkins University data.The Omicron variant has been identified in every US state, in addition to Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico, according to public statements from hospital systems and state officials in their respective states.More than 69,700 Covid-19 patients were in US hospitals on Wednesday -- a number that\'s been trending up since it dipped to around 45,000 on November 8, according to Health and Human Services Department data.The US averaged 1,324 Covid-19 deaths a day over the last week, 11% higher than a week prior, according to Johns Hopkins.Residents wait in line to receive free Covid-19 at-home test kits on Tuesday in Chelsea, Massachusetts.Hospital beds scarce in some parts of the countryThe surge in cases has also led to a scarcity of hospital beds in pockets of the country. \'An event canceled is better than a life canceled,\' WHO chief warns ahead of holiday seasonIn Delaware, ChristianaCare Hospital is running over 100% capacity, often reaching 110% to 115%, said its president, Sharon Kurfuerst.""There are patients receiving care in hallways because that is the only place we have to put them in the emergency department right now,"" she said. Many people who delayed treatment for nearly two years for non-Covid-19 related health issues currently need medical attention, Kurfuerst added.""That, compounded by the amount of Covid patients that we are seeing today is really straining our health care system and resources,"" she said. In Ohio, six hospitals in the Cleveland area took out a page ad Sunday in the local newspaper, pleading for help.""We need your help,"" the ad read. ""We now have more COVID-19 patients in our hospitals than ever before. And the overwhelming majority are unvaccinated.""NHL to pause season Wednesday and resume after ChristmasGetting vaccinated is the most effective tool to prevent serious illness. As of Tuesday, nearly 62% of the US population had been fully vaccinated, while just over 30% had received a booster shot, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People who have been previously infected with Covid-19 and remain unvaccinated ""should not assume that (they) have protection against Omicron,"" US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said Tuesday. ""That\'s not enough to be able to come to a family gathering and say, \'This is just as good as being vaccinated,\'"" Murthy told CNN\'s Wolf Blitzer. ""So, if you\'re not vaccinated, it is more urgent than ever to get vaccinated. If you are vaccinated, please get boosted."" As US health officials urge vaccination and boosters, Israel is rolling out a fourth vaccine dose for certain people: those ages 60 and over, medical workers and people with suppressed immune systems.In Israel, those eligible for the fourth dose can receive it if at least four months have passed since the third dose, the nation\'s Prime Minister\'s Office said. Almost all vaccinated citizens in that country have received the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine.As to whether the US could move to a fourth dose eventually, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told CNN this: ""Certainly when we see science, we\'ll examine that we will absolutely consider it,"" she said Tuesday on ""AC360."" ""Right now, we\'re working to make sure that our vaccinated people get (a) booster -- we really do want to make sure that people get a boost.""""It is clear that is what (the US is) going to do -- we are just going to take an unnecessarily long time"" to get there. Additionally, and related to a potential fourth booster here in the US, Reiner wants to see not only a sense of urgency, but also ""nimbleness"" on the part of the Biden White House -- with the administration reacting to changing facts on the ground rather than, as Reiner said has happened previously, ""be surprised and then wait.""Now in the US, Covid-19 vaccine boosters mean a third shot for people who initially received two doses of an mRNA vaccine -- those made by Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna -- or a second shot for those who received a single Johnson & Johnson dose. Adults may get boosted with any of the three vaccine brands, regardless of which they received initially; 16- and 17-year-olds are only eligible to receive the Pfizer booster.Local officials impose new rules to combat surgeSome local officials are again imposing new regulations to curb the spread of the virus.In Chicago, customers at most businesses that serve food or drinks must show proof of vaccination beginning January 3, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said. The measure will apply to all customers over age 5 at restaurants, bars, gyms, theaters and other entertainment and sporting venues that serve food and drink.Cleveland area hospitals battling latest Covid-19 surge put ad in local paper that reads: \'Help\'""The unvaccinated are affecting the health, well-being and livelihoods of all the rest of us,"" Lightfoot said. ""To control the spread, we have to limit the risk."" Florida\'s Miami-Dade County is reinstating a mask mandate in county buildings, Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said Wednesday.Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms also moved to reinstate the city\'s indoor mask mandate, while Massachusetts\' public health department is recommending that all residents wear a mask indoors when not in their own homes, regardless of their vaccination status, officials said Tuesday.And in New York, the police department is seeing an increase in the number of officers calling out sick, including fully vaccinated officers, according to numbers shared with CNN by a senior NYPD official.Covid-19 isolation period could be reducedAmid the latest surge, officials are considering shortening the 10-day isolation period for those who test positive, particularly for health care workers, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Tuesday. How long should you isolate if you\'re fully vaccinated but have Covid-19? There is some debate""For example, if you get a health care worker who\'s infected and without any symptoms at all, you don\'t want to keep that person out of work too very long ... particularly if we get a run on hospital beds and the need for health care personnel,"" said Fauci, who is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The isolation period also affects airline staffing, prompting Delta Air Lines officials to ask the CDC to reduce the period to five days as Christmas approaches -- adding that more than 90% of its workforce is vaccinated.Officials are conducting analysis on whether it\'s safe to shorten the isolation period, Murthy said.CNN\'s Melissa Alonso, Amanda Sealy, Jason Hanna, Oren Liebermann, Artemis Moshtaghian, Jennifer Henderson, Pervaiz Shallwani, Mark Morales, Ben Tinker, Gregory Lemos and Naomi Thomas contributed to this report.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN)As President Biden struggles through the roughest patch of his presidency yet -- with his poll numbers in the doldrums and the cornerstone of his Build Back Better legislation in peril -- he can look back at one unalloyed success in his first year. The Senate has confirmed a record number of his nominees to the federal judiciary -- the most of any president at this stage in 40 years -- and at a time when that achievement matters more than ever. In its final days in session for the year, the Senate confirmed 10 district judges, giving Biden a total of 40 confirmations, a tie with Ronald Reagan\'s record. By comparison, the Senate confirmed 18 circuit and district court judges in President Donald Trump\'s first year in office, and 12 in President Barack Obama\'s first year. Biden\'s achievement is especially important at a time when partisanship in the judiciary is nearly as pervasive as it is in the political branches.Republicans learned this lesson before Democrats did. When Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican, was Senate majority leader during the Trump years, he put judicial confirmations at the top of his agenda. Thanks to McConnell, the Senate confirmed 54 appellate judges during Trump\'s one term, just one fewer than Obama appointed in his two terms. McConnell\'s Supreme CourtIn overall numbers, according to Pew Research Center, Trump\'s total of 226 in his single term is below the totals of recent two-term presidents, including Obama (320), George W. Bush (322) and Bill Clinton (367). But according to a Washington Post analysis, Trump appointed the youngest group of judges since at least the start of the 20th century. The average age of his appellate court judges was 47, about five years younger than Obama\'s appellate judges. Since all federal judges enjoy life tenure, Trump created a legacy that would be difficult to reverse.But Biden -- with the crucial assistance of Chuck Schumer, the current Senate majority leader, and Richard Durbin, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee -- has fought back. While the Senate has struggled to move much of Biden\'s legislative agenda, Schumer has filled the time with confirmations, and his fellow Democrats (including the otherwise resistant Joe Manchin and Krysten Sinema) have confirmed every one. Biden\'s judges so far are generally younger and more diverse than even Obama\'s were. For example, according to figures compiled by the American Constitution Society, about 80 percent of Biden\'s judicial nominees have been women, compared to 42 percent for Obama and 24 percent for Trump. About 36 percent of Obama\'s nominees were members of minority groups, compared to about 67 percent for Biden, and 16 percent for Trump. And Biden has drawn from a broader pool of lawyers, too. Obama chose a great many former prosecutors for the bench, Biden has looked to defense lawyers as well. Halfway into his first year, Biden\'s legacy in this regard is formidable already.Read MoreOpinion: Clarence Thomas Is the new Chief Justice Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. has famously asserted that our nation\'s judges are independent of politics and ""dedicated"" to nonpartisanship. ""We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges,"" he said. But in recent years the difference between Democratic and Republican judicial appointees has been vast and growing. This is not because the judges are unethical or partisan hacks (at least most of them), but rather because judicial philosophy and political orientation have rarely been as closely aligned as they are today. Democrats and Republicans simply have different and profound disagreements about what the Constitution means.Consider several recent legal controversies. In October, Robert Pitman, an Obama appointee to the federal district court in Texas, ruled that the state\'s draconian anti-abortion rights law known as SB 8 was unconstitutional. Republican-appointed judges overturned him. Similarly, four Democratic appointees have ruled against Trump\'s effort to prevent Congress from gaining access to executive branch records in the investigation of the January 6 riot at the Capitol: The district court ruling was by an Obama appointee, and it was affirmed by a DC Circuit panel of two Obama judges and one Biden judge. Republican-appointed judges have, in turn, stymied Democratic priorities, as when a three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit rejected the Biden administration\'s vaccine mandate for large employers. The judges were one Reagan and two Trump appointees. Attorney General Merrick Garland, don\'t prosecute Donald Trump Of course, one Trump record that Biden cannot hope to equal involves the most important federal court of all. McConnell\'s most consequential acts as majority leader allowed Trump to fill three seats on the Supreme Court. McConnell forbade consideration of Merrick Garland as a replacement for Antonin Scalia during the last year of Obama\'s presidency, paving the way for Trump to nominate Neil Gorsuch in his inaugural year. He then steered Brett Kavanaugh through a tumultuous confirmation and then jammed through the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett in the waning days of Trump\'s presidency. The Supreme Court is now the most partisan of federal courts, one with a clear conservative majority on such issues as abortion, affirmative action, gun safety and many others. Even if Stephen Breyer, the 83-year-old liberal, retires in the next year and Biden replaces him, the current President cannot reasonably hope to change that lineup in the near future.Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion\'s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookAnd Biden\'s first-term record of judicial accomplishment stands on a fragile base as well. If the Democrats lose even a single Senate seat in the 2022 midterms (as historical trends suggest they will), McConnell will again be majority leader and in a position to bring judicial confirmations to a halt. Certainly, McConnell will not allow Biden to fill a seat on the Supreme Court. That means Biden, along with Schumer and Durbin, will have to keep up the same pace of appointing and confirming judges in the next year if they want a legacy that even Mitch McConnell can\'t undo.', ""Commander is the Biden family's new German shepherd.@POTUS/TwitterIn pictures: Presidential pets through historyUpdated 12:17 PM ET, Tue December 21, 2021Commander is the Biden family's new German shepherd.@POTUS/TwitterA new puppy is in the White House.Commander, a German shepherd, arrived on Monday, December 20.

(CNN)President Joe Biden is struggling in the minds of the American public. While his approval rating is down on a slew of issues, his difficulties are perhaps most noticeable on the economy. Biden now sports the lowest net economic rating of any president at this point through their first term since at least Jimmy Carter in 1977. In the latest CNN/SSRS poll, Biden comes in with a 44% approval rating to 55% disapproval rating among registered voters on his economic performance. This makes for a -9 point net approval rating. The average of all polls taken in December is quite similar with Biden at -13 points on the economy. To put that in perspective, the average president at this point in the last 44 years (since we have been polling on the topic) had a net economic approval rating of +5 points. That means Biden\'s is 18 points worse than the average. Who\'s to blame for inflation? It\'s complicatedThe best rating, perhaps unsurprisingly, belonged to George W. Bush following the September 11 attacks. He was at +37 points at a time when his approval ratings on all issues were high thanks to the ""rally around the flag"" effect. Read MoreNotably, Biden\'s net rating is worse than his two immediate predecessors, Barack Obama in December 2009 and Donald Trump in December 2017. Both Obama and Trump had net approval ratings on the economy of -4 points. The economy was, by a lot of measures, in deep trouble in December 2009. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index was well below average at 72.5. Today, it\'s at a similar 70.4. Yet, Biden\'s ratings on the economy are considerably worse. Trump was a different story. Consumer sentiment was at 95.9 in December 2017, but Trump\'s overall net approval ratings (-20 points) were so bad that they were dragging down his popularity on a host of issues. Interestingly, Trump\'s problem then is the opposite of Biden\'s now. Back in late 2017, most voters were not concentrated on the economy. It was not the nation\'s top problem. Ergo, what Americans saw as a relatively stronger economy wasn\'t translating into helping Trump. Today, the economy is viewed as the top problem for both the nation and for people\'s families, so the low consumer sentiment is dragging Biden down. A Monmouth University poll released earlier this month found that 41% listed economic concerns (either everyday bills and groceries; inflation; job security and employment; or the economy overall) as the top issue for their family. That\'s far more than for any other issue. Inflation, in particular, seems to be a big issue for Biden. Just 28% of Americans approved of the job he is doing to handle inflation in a recent ABC News/Ipsos poll. This comes as more voters said they were concerned about inflation than any other issue in a December Fox News poll, and only 22% said the Biden\'s administration efforts to get inflation and rising prices under control were helping. The plurality (47%) said they were hurting. Indeed, the issue of inflation hurting a president helps to put Biden\'s bad position in perspective. The public reaction now looks at least somewhat similar to how the public was reacting to another president under whom inflation was an issue: Carter. A lot of Republicans like to draw parallels between Carter (who was a one-term president) and Biden. And at least early on, when it comes to public perceptions of the economy and inflation, there are some similarities between them. Carter\'s economic net approval rating of -8 points in an early January 1978 CBS News/New York Times poll was the lowest around this point in a presidency before Biden\'s -13 points. The economy, and particularly inflation, was listed as the nation\'s top problem in a late October 1977 Gallup poll. Importantly, far more Americans (52%) in a November 1977 Time Magazine poll thought that Carter was not making a good start to fighting inflation than thought he was (21%). In other words, Americans felt his efforts were not enough to control inflation. The good news for Biden is that it\'s far from clear what the economy and inflation will look like in the future. Carter ended up losing in 1980, in part, because voters felt he didn\'t solve the economic crisis. Biden, on the other hand, still has nearly three years until the 2024 election, although his party may still suffer in the midterms because of fears voters have about the economy.']","['Lani Guinier, voting rights champion and former assistant attorney general nominee, dies at 71By Shawna Mizelle, CNNUpdated 9:36 PM ET, Fri January 7, 2022 In this December 4, 1993, file photo, Lani Guinier accepts the ACLU of Southern California Bill of Rights Award at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, California.

(CNN)Vice President Kamala Harris\' newly announced communications director Jamal Simmons is apologizing for decade-old tweets on ""undocumented folks"" that resurfaced after news of his appointment.A trio of tweets from November 2010 got renewed attention in the day since Simmons\' hiring was reported. In one, he wrote, ""Just saw 2 undocumented folks talking on MSNBC. One Law student the other a protester. Can someone explain why ICE is not picking them up?."" Minutes later, he responded to a user saying he was ""not mixing anything or suggesting ICE shld pick them up. Just seems odd u can go on TV & admit breaking law & not be arrested.""And, in what appears to be an attempt to do clean up, Simmons tweeted again that same day, ""I\'ll try this again: Just saw 2 undocumented folks talking on MSNBC and have serious legal question. Why wouldn\'t ICE pick them up.""In a statement obtained by CNN, Simmons wrote, ""As a pundit for much of my career I have tweeted a lot and spoken out on public issues. Sometimes I have been sarcastic, unclear, or just plainly missed the mark. I sincerely apologize for offending those who care as much as I do about making America the best, multi-ethnic, diverse democracy it can be. I know the role I am taking on is to represent the Biden-Harris administration, and I will do so with humility, sincerity and respect.""In a tweet later Friday, Simmons wrote: ""For the record, I\'ve never advocated for, nor believed that Dreamers should be targeted by ICE agents. I\'ve been for DACA + comprehensive immigration reform for years. Frankly, it\'s depressing ppl can forget about every other thing I\'ve said in public on this bc of bad tweets.""Read MoreHarris, Simmons\' new boss, leads the administration\'s diplomatic efforts in stemming the flow of migration from the Northern Triangle and she\'s faced scrutiny and criticism in her role, including from Republicans who have sought to cast her as the face of the Biden administration\'s politically perilous immigration issues. She has also faced criticism from progressive immigration activists who say the administration has not done enough to unwind former President Donald Trump\'s immigration policies after about a year in office.News of Simmons\' hire was the first of what is expected to be a communications overhaul of sorts for the vice president, who spent her first year in office in defense mode following a myriad of reports, including by CNN, of staff infighting and dysfunction. It\'s yet another tough break for a vice president who has been shadowed by communications issues throughout her first year in office.Simmons, according to various biographies, has worked in politics and media for more than two decades, helping elect former Democratic presidents like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama as well as appearing on CNN, NPR, MSNBC and CBS among others.This story has been updated with an additional comment from Simmons.CNN\'s Shawna Mizelle contributed to this report.', 'Actor Sidney Poitier stars in ""Buck and the Preacher,"" a film that he also directed in 1972.

(Photo by Scott Cunningham/Getty Images) (CNN)Former President Jimmy Carter warned Wednesday that democracy is being threatened throughout the country, cautioning that ""our great nation now teeters on the brink of a widening abyss."" Carter, writing in a New York Times op-ed published on the eve of the anniversary of the January 6 insurrection, charged that ""without immediate action, we are at genuine risk of civil conflict and losing our precious democracy.""""Americans,"" the 97-year-old former President said, ""must set aside differences and work together before it is too late.""A year ago, the Democrat had joined the three other living former Presidents -- Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton -- in deriding the violent rioters who stormed the Capitol as Congress met to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election for President Joe Biden. On Wednesday, Carter wrote that ""promoters of the lie that the election was stolen have taken over one political party and stoked distrust in our electoral systems.""Fact check: Five enduring lies about the Capitol insurrectionCarter said he had hope that the deadly attack on the Capitol ""would shock the nation into addressing the toxic polarization that threatens our democracy.""Read MoreBut politicians, he said, ""have leveraged the distrust they have created to enact laws that empower partisan legislatures to intervene in election processes"" and ""seek to win by any means, and many Americans are being persuaded to think and act likewise, threatening to collapse the foundations of our security and democracy with breathtaking speed.""""I now fear that what we have fought so hard to achieve globally -- the right to free, fair elections, unhindered by strongman politicians who seek nothing more than to grow their own power -- has become dangerously fragile at home,"" said Carter, who in his post-presidency started the Carter Center, a nonprofit that monitors free elections around the globe.The former President offered five points to secure elections in the United States: American citizens must agree on constitutional norms and respect each other despite political differences; the country should push for election reforms to ensure access to and confidence in elections; the country should resist polarization; the country should reject violence in politics; and lastly, disinformation must be addressed.""For American democracy to endure, we must demand that our leaders and candidates uphold the ideals of freedom and adhere to high standards of conduct,"" he said.', 'Top Democratic operatives plan to do what the party says they shouldn\'t: Talk about Trump in 2022By Edward-Isaac Dovere, CNNUpdated 5:06 AM ET, Wed January 5, 2022  (CNN)Some top Democratic operatives are terrified that their down-ballot candidates are responding too timidly to the threat of former President Donald Trump using this year\'s midterm elections to launch a return to the White House, and they\'ve formed a new group to raise the alarm. The super PAC, whose creation was shared first with CNN, doesn\'t have a subtle name: Stop Him Now. Its aim is calling attention to Republican candidates\' ties to Trump and his efforts to subvert the 2020 election, as well as how GOP wins up and down the ballot this year could help further undermine systems designed to keep elections fair and democratic. Trump has signaled he wants Republican victories to lay the groundwork for another presidential bid, and these Democrats think their party needs to start talking about that a lot more -- and quickly.The new group will be targeting members of Congress running for reelection, as well as state-level candidates who are using lies about the 2020 election to try to springboard into higher office, often with Trump\'s backing.The Stop Him Now operatives know they\'re in deliberate defiance of the many Democratic politicians and pundits who\'ve decided that they will lose the more they talk about the former President. Already, the same House Democrats who impeached Trump twice have been fighting among themselves over whether to mention him in their midterm campaign efforts. Read More\'It\'s not a silver bullet\': Democrats weigh how to talk about January 6 on the 2022 campaign trailIt\'s no coincidence the super PAC is launching on Thursday -- the anniversary of the Capitol insurrection -- with its first ad built around footage of the rioters. It will run online, with the hope of calling more attention to the effort, though the group declined to share details about how much money it will be spending on the initial ad or the budget it\'s aiming for.""We were alarmed by the growing conventional wisdom in our party that we should stop talking about Trump -- alarmed by that and what was happening to our country,"" said Mandy Grunwald, a longtime Democratic consultant who spent years as an adviser to both Bill and Hillary Clinton, among many other high-level Democrats.Grunwald formed the group with Saul Shorr, another veteran Democratic consultant with a huge roster of top clients, including Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic nominee in last year\'s Virginia governor\'s race. Both tend to be behind-the-scenes players, and they say their public involvement in Stop Him Now reflects just how committed they are to the idea.Also already working with the PAC are Democratic ad makers Jimmy Siegel and Miriam Hess and Teddy Goff, who was one of the top digital strategists for both Barack Obama\'s and Hillary Clinton\'s campaigns. Several of the people involved in Stop Him Now have put in their own money and all are donating time and expertise, while preparing to tap into their extensive political networks for more help and fundraising. Republicans have been predicting that the November midterms will be like those in 1994 or 2010, which both produced massive GOP waves against first-term Democratic presidents. The Stop Him Now organizers believe that by lighting up fears among Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans that the GOP is coddling a destabilizing, anti-democratic force, they might be able to buck the historical trend of the president\'s party losing seats in the midterms. They point to the dynamic of the 2002 midterms -- another historical aberration -- when Republicans expanded their majority by attacking Democrats, in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, as being weak on protecting America. While President Joe Biden plans to focus on his own accomplishments -- the White House has made it a point to avoid even saying Trump\'s name publicly -- and individual Democratic candidates craft their own approaches, the Stop Him Now operatives say they\'ll look to keep the focus on the former President by targeting online ads and other efforts in competitive states and districts.Democratic governors worry about threat to democracy but don\'t see it as a winning message for 2022 They are also responding to Democrats\' worries that they enter this campaign year without enough of their own good story to tell, with Biden\'s social safety net bill and voting rights legislation languishing in Congress and a pandemic that seems like it will never end. Despite major legislative accomplishments in Biden\'s first year -- including Covid relief and a bipartisan infrastructure law -- many voters regularly say they either don\'t know about what the administration did or don\'t feel its impact on their lives. While Republican voters proved in last year\'s elections that they\'ll turn out heavily even without Trump on the ballot, Democrats don\'t see anything else that can motivate their own voters like Trump did in 2018, when they flipped the House, and in 2020, when they won a razor-thin Senate majority thanks to Vice President Kamala Harris\' tie-breaking vote. Meanwhile, polls show Trump\'s strength among Republican voters has only increased, while there\'s been overall disappointment in Biden. ""There needs to be a national cloud over the election about a choice between Democrats and Republicans, and the Republican Party\'s link to Trump, Trumpism and the threat to democracy,"" Shorr said.The lessons of 2021And yet when McAuliffe lost last year in Virginia -- after Biden had carried it by 10 points just a year earlier -- most political pundits and Democratic talking heads decided that his heavily Trump-centric message was to blame and they needed to change the subject in 2022. This misses the point, Grunwald said. ""The reaction in our party implies that it\'s a zero-sum game: We only talk about Trump or we never talk about Trump. We\'re in the \'and\' zone. People want to talk about the economy and what\'s happening in people\'s lives, and all kinds of stuff,"" she said. ""But you just can\'t ignore this. It\'s that sense that you have to choose, it\'s one or the other: Because Terry McAuliffe didn\'t win, and he talked about Trump, that\'s the end of it. That\'s nonsense.""Democrats look for lessons in Virginia and New Jersey as a blame game inside the party ragesDemocratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison has made a similar argument publicly and privately, saying he thinks Democratic leaders are ignoring reality if they don\'t acknowledge Trump as a major factor and likely 2024 presidential candidate. Facing a recall election in September, California Gov. Gavin Newsom did embrace that message and won. He easily defeated the effort to remove him from office by arguing that Trump-style policies, particularly around the pandemic, would lead to a dark fate for his state. He was especially helped by having a foil in right-wing talk radio host Larry Elder, the leading Republican candidate vying to replace him, who was more easily tied to Trump than the GOP nominee in Virginia. But California is also a much bluer state than Virginia. And in the months since Republican Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin\'s victory, some Democrats and the media have zeroed in on a post-election memo about the Virginia race that argued that the anti-Trump strategy is not a path to victory in the places with competitive elections in 2022. Conducted by the firm ALG Research, it was drawn from focus groups with Biden 2020 voters who voted for Youngkin in 2021.""The Youngkin = Trump hits didn\'t work very well. We\'re not saying this was a mistake, or that Terry had a better message he left on the table,"" the memo\'s authors argue. ""We don\'t know. But we do know that if our most-effective message in 2022 is that Republicans = Trump, we\'re going to get creamed.""The Stop Him Now organizers contend that the lower Democratic turnout in last year\'s New Jersey gubernatorial race versus Virginia\'s was in fact due to how little incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy talked about Trump. (Murphy ended up narrowly winning in the Garden State, but he drew several hundred thousand fewer votes than either McAuliffe or Youngkin in a state of comparable size.)As evidence, a strategy memo laying out the Stop Him Now reasoning cites a word cloud based on voters\' most common negative impressions about Youngkin taken from McAuliffe surveys a week before the election. By far, the dominant negative thought was ""Trump."" In the word cloud, it\'s huge. Likewise, internal data compiled by the Democratic-aligned Senate Majority PAC in October showed that when Democratic voters in battleground states were asked what their top concerns were about Republicans winning majorities in Congress, one of them was: ""set stage for Trump comeback."" Stop Him Now\'s first ad leans into that.  Set to a piano tinkling through the first few bars of ""America the Beautiful,"" the ad is mostly footage of the violence from the Capitol riot. ""Next time they won\'t just be wearing horns and wielding weapons. Donald Trump is marshaling another force to take over the US Capitol: his army of Republican supporters running in the midterms, intent on helping him return to power."" The ad then flashes frames of Trump being embraced at rallies by prominent Republican politicians, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker, as well as several leaders not on the ballot in the fall, like Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Josh Hawley of Missouri. It ends by flashing text onscreen: ""Republicans in \'22 means Trump in \'24.""The ad is reminiscent of several that ran in last year\'s Virginia races, including one from Attorney General Mark Herring, a Democrat, against the GOP candidate, which used similar footage of January 6 and a voice-over saying, ""The threat is real."" Herring lost, but by half a percentage point. Jim Mulhall, one of the consultants who made the ad, said he still believes that Trump-centric approach was the right one. The year favored Republicans and Herring was running under McAuliffe, whose campaign lost its footing in the final weeks. But by centering on the Trump message, Mulhall said, the attorney general barely lost and managed to pull in more votes than the top of the ticket. Democrats more widely should not overread the loss, he argued, and think about how to raise the specter of Trump. ""It\'s happening either way. In 2024, the nominee is going to be Trump or a close Trump ally with him yammering away,"" Mulhall said.  Democrats also expect they\'ll have an easier time tying this year\'s Republican candidates to Trump than they did with Youngkin, who managed to keep his distance by being a newcomer to politics and self-funding $20 million into his campaign. Most Republicans on the ballot this year won\'t have any of that going for them, and unlike Youngkin, if they\'re to emerge as their party\'s nominees, they\'ll have to clear primaries that have already devolved into Trump loyalty contests. Many also have records and comments that tie them closely to Trump, including the 147 House Republicans who voted to overturn the election even in the hours immediately after the riot, and the dozens of state legislators who have turned themselves into local champions of his election lies. Trump is already more engaged than he was in the 2021 elections. Although he endorsed Youngkin, he didn\'t go to Virginia to campaign for him. But for 2022, he\'s already endorsed far down the ballot to the secretary of state level. He issued an endorsement of the GOP governor of Alaska, conditioned on the incumbent not supporting Sen. Lisa Murkowski, whom Trump has it in for because she voted to convict him in his second impeachment trial. He\'s ignored House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\'s requests to sit out certain races, and has openly solicited candidates to take on GOP incumbents.So the biggest force pushing Democrats into talking about Trump may be Trump himself.""You\'re going to see Trump campaigning all over the country. A huge swath of this country believes he\'s going to run again,"" Shorr said. ""He\'s going to put himself at the center of this argument. For us to ignore that would be a mistake.""

Charlie Shoemaker/Getty Images', 'Harry Reid took a risk on Barack ObamaOpinion by David Axelrod, CNN Senior Political CommentatorUpdated 2:01 PM ET, Wed December 29, 2021 JUST WATCHEDA look back at the life and legacy of Harry ReidReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHA look back at the life and legacy of Harry Reid 04:51David Axelrod, a senior CNN political commentator and host of ""The Axe Files,"" was a senior adviser to President Barack Obama and chief strategist for the 2008 and 2012 Obama presidential campaigns. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN)In the spring of 2006, I received an unexpected call from my friend and client, Barack Obama, who was then a little more than a year into his career in the US Senate.""I just had the strangest conversation with Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer,"" he told me, fresh from a meeting with the US Senate Democratic leaders. ""I didn\'t know why they were calling me over there. Turns out they wanted to tell me I should run for president.""Harry Reid, a longtime US senator from Nevada and former Democratic leader, dies at 82  Reid, then Senate minority leader, argued that, unlike the presumptive frontrunner -- Hillary Clinton -- Obama was untainted by a vote for the unpopular war in Iraq, an albatross the leader feared would sink her and take some of his party\'s Senate candidates down in the undertow. Far from viewing Obama\'s newness to Washington, DC, as an impediment, Reid, who had served there for over 20 years, argued that the young senator\'s freshness would be an asset to a country hungry for change.""They pushed me pretty hard to think about it,"" Obama told me, still absorbing the full meaning of what had just transpired. ""I still think it\'s pretty far-fetched, but it\'s interesting that they felt as strongly as they do."" I can\'t say that Obama would never have come around to the idea of running for president without the quiet encouragement of Reid that spring. But I can say for sure that their conversation made a deep impression on the young senator, who knew that Reid hadn\'t fought his way up through the rough-and-tumble of Nevada politics and the ranks of the US Senate by making careless bets.Read MoreThe fact that the leader would buck the party establishment, of which he was part, by planting the seeds of an insurgency was an unexpected turn that begged serious consideration.As different as they seemed, a tremendous bond grew between the understated Reid -- who died Tuesday at 82 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer -- and the charismatic young president he helped propel forward. Reid\'s improbable rise from hardscrabble beginnings in the tiny brothel town of Searchlight, Nevada, was the stuff of legends, and he saw in Obama someone who had overcome his own hardships -- along with withering racial barriers -- to achieve unimaginable heights.JUST WATCHEDGergen looks back on Harry Reid\'s career in the SenateReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHGergen looks back on Harry Reid\'s career in the Senate 02:29After the election of 2008, Reid, by then Senate majority leader, sat down with President-elect Obama. A prizefighter in his youth, Reid made a point by recalling his days in the ring. ""I wasn\'t the fastest guy. I wasn\'t the strongest. But I sure could take a punch!""And he would take, and throw, many punches for Obama\'s agenda. Along with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Reid\'s persistence helped deliver the Affordable Care Act after an epic battle, an achievement which he said had particular meaning to him because of the privations he had seen uninsured family members and neighbors suffer in his life.""I felt a tremendous pressure to get it done. And having been raised the way that I was with no health care, my mother had no teeth, we didn\'t go to doctors... it was one of the landmark pieces of legislation in the history of this country,"" he told me in 2019. But if Reid, who served as the Democratic leader for 12 years, was a point man for his president, he also was a hard-nosed realist when it came to protecting the members of his caucus from unnecessarily risky votes.He called me in the early summer of 2009 and wanted to talk about a cap-and-trade bill we had passed through the US House of Representatives to reduce the carbon emissions that were accelerating climate change. The bill was controversial in energy-producing states, and the House vote had been a heavy lift. Now we were hoping for a vote in the Senate, which we knew would be even more challenging.""You know we have a lot going on up here this summer, what with the health care bill and a lot of other things we absolutely have to get done,"" Reid said. ""So we\'re not going to get to the climate bill."" He paused. ""Would you tell the President?"" At that moment, the line went dead, which is how every telephone conversation with the leader ended.JUST WATCHEDHarry Reid: I do not regret changing the Senate rulesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHarry Reid: I do not regret changing the Senate rules 03:44""I\'m not much for small talk. The conversation was over; we\'d done our business. There\'s no need to talk anymore,"" he explained to me in 2019 when I asked him about this and his legendary habit of ending calls without saying goodbye.Throughout those years, Reid tangled regularly with Mitch McConnell, who as the Senate Republican leader, led an implacable opposition to Obama, including the brazen decision to block the Senate for the better part of the President\'s final year from taking up the nomination of Merrick Garland to the US Supreme Court.When I last sat down with Reid for ""The Axe Files,"" Reid had plenty to say about that blockade, yet he refrained from making it personal. A proud and pugnacious partisan, he also was a man of the institution. At the end of his life, he was not going to impugn his longtime adversary.  ""I know Mitch McConnell very well, and I\'m not going to disparage him here today,"" he said. ""But I have been somewhat disappointed. I think what he did with the Supreme Court is something that will go down in history as a very dark time in the history of this country.""Reid was a rare person in today\'s politics. A plainspoken man, allergic to flowery rhetoric and performative politics; relentless -- even ruthless -- in pursuit of legislative and electoral victories but animated by time-honored verities and ideals to which he held fast until the end.  And he was palpably proud of his partnership with the 44th president.Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion\'s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookOn the last lap of Obama\'s final campaign in 2012, we made a stop for a rally in Las Vegas.  Reid had requested a minute with Obama to ask him to cut an ad for Mazie Hirono, the Democratic Senate candidate in Hawaii. But after he made the ask, the leader suddenly reached out and hugged the President, a physical display of fellowship and affection that surprised us. Then he turned abruptly and, like a Reid phone call, he was gone without another word.In 2019, I asked him about that moment and his relationship with the President for whom he had made such a difference.""Well, I don\'t hesitate to say on this show, I don\'t care who\'s listening and this is something I don\'t throw around very often, but I love Barack Obama, I really do,"" he told me. ""No one else could do what he did.""Right back at you, Sen. Reid. May you rest in peace. And may your remarkable memory always be a blessing.', 'Former US Sen.

But his hopes of a 2022 rebound are complicated by equally treacherous tests abroad.The United States faces at least two potential national security crises that could explode in short order. First, it must try to head off a potential invasion of Ukraine by Russia in what would be Moscow\'s boldest bid yet to reshape the post-Cold War order. And unless talks bear fruit soon, Iran could reach the threshold of being a nuclear weapons power, and leave Biden with an excruciating choice of whether to respond with military action that could draw the US back into a Middle East conflagration.As grave as each situation is, both in some ways are a distraction from the epochal 21st-century US foreign policy conundrum: how to handle an increasingly powerful and aggressive China. The intense diplomatic and military attention Washington would need to devote to a showdown with Iran or Russia would delight Beijing, after its rise to prominence coincided with the US quagmires in Iraq and Afghanistan.Of course, a restive world could present Biden with unexpected problems. For instance, no president, possibly since Bill Clinton in the 1990s, has thwarted North Korea\'s nuclear march. And the Stalinist state, marking 10 years under volatile dictator Kim Jong Un, is forging ahead with missiles that could deliver its nuclear bombs to US soil. The Middle East is stuck in the crosshairs of a worsening US-China rivalry But Pyongyang is not alone in defying the US. Biden\'s political fortunes back home have been partly tarnished by rising gasoline prices following his failure to coax major oil producers in the Gulf to pump more crude. The pandemic, meanwhile, threatens to cause more upheaval overseas that could impact US national security. And the Omicron surge could again jam up global supply chains -- ramping up the inflation that threatens Biden\'s Democrats in midterm elections next year.Read MoreIt\'s not all been bad news for the President, a former Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman who boasted on the campaign trail of his statesmanship chops. There has been some diplomatic deftness in his first year in office. Declaring ""America is back,"" Biden soothed allies bruised by former President Donald Trump\'s tantrums and insults. He\'s convinced Western governments to draw up a daunting package of punishments for Russia to deter it from breaching Ukraine\'s borders -- and is offering security talks to Moscow in a long-shot bid to ease tensions. Early last year, he appeared to talk Russian President Vladimir Putin down after a previous Ukraine buildup. And while Trump reset America\'s course in adopting a confrontational posture toward China, Biden has done better in getting US allies in Europe and the Pacific to back US strategy. But his diplomacy has yet to change President Xi Jinping\'s nationalistic, expansionist path, after crushing Hong Kong\'s remaining democracy and as fears grow that he might eventually try to reunify Taiwan with the mainland by force -- a move that could suck the United States into a disastrous war with its Asian rival.Immediate tests as the new year dawnsBiden\'s foreign policy credibility will come in for early scrutiny in 2022.The most intensive diplomatic offensive of his administration so far is seeking to convince Putin to stand down tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine. The integrity of NATO and the health of his own political position depend on Biden defusing the crisis without caving to security guarantees demanded by the Russian leader. Putin, for instance, wants NATO to pull forces from ex-Warsaw Pact nations that joined the alliance -- a condition that could destroy Western credibility and incentivize further Russian adventurism. \'A four-week window\': Biden aims to learn from Obama\'s mistakes with quick moves to deter Putin from invading UkraineIn the latest development, the White House said Tuesday that US and Russian officials would meet on January 10. US, Russian and NATO officials will also be in touch over the following few days. Russia has been agitating for another in-person Biden-Putin summit, a piece of diplomatic choreography that would evoke old Cold War sit-downs. But Biden must walk a fine line -- as he could be accused of appeasing Putin should he eventually move on Ukraine -- while finding an off-ramp for the Russian leader that allows him to save face. The showdown has profound political implications for both Biden and Putin. And the Russian leader, who sees a historic task of reestablishing Russian power at the expense of the US, is a wily adversary who has outmaneuvered the last three US presidents.As their European counterparts try to prevent a war on the continent, America\'s nuclear negotiators are striving to revive the 2015 nuclear deal involving the US and Iran, which was fractured by Trump\'s walkout.Despite some optimism expressed by Russian negotiators at the latest session of talks in Vienna underway since Monday, the US has been deeply skeptical that the diplomatic track will deliver. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Tuesday that it was ""too soon to tell"" whether Iran\'s new hardline government has returned to the table interested in negotiating. And any progress still fell short of ""Iran\'s accelerating nuclear steps,"" Price added.New talks -- at which the US and Iran don\'t meet directly -- are unfolding after top US negotiator Robert Malley issued a dire warning days before Christmas. He told CNN\'s Becky Anderson that Tehran\'s increasing uranium enrichment meant that time was running short for a deal.""If they continue at their current pace, we have some weeks left but not much more than that, at which point, I think, the conclusion will be that there\'s no deal to be revived,"" said Malley, the US Iran envoy. US officials believe Iran is now within months of acquiring the materials for a nuclear bomb. Some Israelis are talking of weeks.Iran is demanding that the US lift all sanctions before it will roll back enrichment. The US is offering a sequenced approach. Its position is complicated by the Biden administration\'s inability to pledge that a future Republican administration would honor any deal. Iran has said it is now enriching uranium up to 60% purity, its highest-ever level and much closer to the 90% threshold needed to build a nuclear bomb. Its progress exposes the utter failure of Trump\'s ""maximum pressure"" policy, introduced when Iran was complying with the Obama administration pact to cap its nuclear program.If diplomacy fails now, Biden -- or ,more immediately, Israel -- will face the question of whether to launch a military strike against Tehran\'s facilities that could set the Middle East aflame once again.Biden\'s fate at home and abroad is entwinedMuch of Biden\'s overseas leverage in coming days depends on how he is perceived by US allies and foes after a year in office.The biggest blemish on his record so far is the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan. The President had pledged to Americans there would be no Saigon-style exit from Kabul, yet that\'s what happened. Administration claims that the hurried evacuation was a massive success were undercut by video footage of what was really happening -- and the deaths of 13 US service members and many more Afghans in a suicide bombing outside the airport. The debacle dented Biden\'s authority at home and abroad, despite claims by Democrats that Americans didn\'t really care how US troops left the nation\'s longest war and that they just wanted them home. The mess also offered an opening for Republicans to brand the new President as feckless -- even though those GOP critics were quiet when Trump was genuflecting to global tyrants. In foreign capitals, the withdrawal that came with little warning for allies raised new questions about US staying power. As did Biden\'s cold-eyed view of US interests.Biden grapples with a Covid-19 testing failure that could have been foreseenTortured domestic politics are also hampering Biden\'s bid to put a stamp on the world. While his swift return to the Paris climate agreement pleased America\'s friends, his capacity to keep commitments is in doubt after West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin said he couldn\'t vote for the President\'s Build Back Better plan, which includes a historic $500 billion investment in fighting global warming. Biden\'s attempt to enlist the world\'s democracies in a quest to preserve the liberal world order is, meanwhile, constantly undermined by Trump\'s incessant attempts to destroy American democracy. And the prospect that the 45th President could return to the White House in 2025 means many foreign powers doubt Biden\'s promise that America is back.Presidents under fire at home often seek easy wins abroad, but Biden lacks such a luxury since he is serving when America\'s global power is more challenged than at any time since World War II. At the same time, raging US political divisions back in the United States offer openings to adversaries like Putin and Xi. It\'s a vicious circle that plays into the hands of Republicans determined to portray Biden as a weak failure. So, as tough as 2022 promises to be for Biden at home, he\'s unlikely to get much relief overseas.CNN\'s Natasha Bertrand and Kyle Feldscher contributed to this report.

He died peacefully this afternoon, surrounded by our family, following a courageous, four-year battle with pancreatic cancer,"" she said in a statement Tuesday.Reid rose from humble beginnings in Searchlight, Nevada, to become the most powerful politician in Nevada history, capping off his political career as the Democratic leader in the Senate, including eight years in the majority.  President Joe Biden, who served with Reid in the Senate, called him one of ""the all-time great Senate Majority Leaders in our history"" in a statement Tuesday. ""He was my leader, my mentor, one of my dearest friends,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a statement Tuesday evening.

Reid underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer in 2018 and said less than a year later that he was in remission. At the time, he told CNN\'s Dana Bash that he felt ""very good"" and that he was ""doing fine.""

He attended high school in Henderson, Nevada, often hitchhiking the 45-mile route. A boxer in his youth, Reid later attended Utah State University before moving to Washington, DC, and working his way through law school at George Washington University by working as an officer for the United States Capitol Police.

Harry ReidReid acknowledges the audience during a Nevada Democrats event in Las Vegas in 2019. A year earlier, he underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer.Hide Caption 33 of 33After law school, Reid returned to Nevada and served as lieutenant governor from 1971 to 1975, the youngest person elected to that role in the state. After losing reelection, Reid served as chair of the Nevada Gaming Commission, a powerful position that oversees and regulates the state\'s casino industry. The job made Reid and his family a target of the mob: After he left that post, his wife found a bomb in the family\'s car, Reid wrote in his memoir. Reid\'s political career grew with Nevada. When the state went from one congressional district to two after the 1980 census, Reid ran for a newly created congressional district around Las Vegas in 1982 and won the general election. He was reelected in 1984. He then successfully ran for Nevada\'s open Senate seat in 1986.  He rose through the leadership ranks there, serving as the chamber\'s Democratic whip from 1999 to 2005. From 2005 through his retirement in 2017, he served as his party\'s leader in the Senate, through Democrats\' time in both the minority and the majority. Playing politics  As the chamber\'s Democratic leader, Reid was a polarizing figure. Republicans argued much of the congressional gridlock stemmed from his hard-ball tactics, but Reid often reveled in playing the political bad guy -- even calling then-President George W. Bush a ""loser"" and a ""liar."" (Later, when Donald Trump was in the White House, Reid told CNN\'s Bash that he wished for Bush ""every day."") Reid is often blamed for deepening an era of political polarization with irascible rhetoric about Republicans and the use of controversial Senate procedures that left traditionalists worried that the consensus that once made the chamber special had vanished forever.  He brought those same tactics to electoral politics, too. During Obama\'s reelection bid in 2012, Reid accused Republican nominee Mitt Romney, with no evidence, of not paying his taxes. Asked by CNN in 2015 whether he regretted the attack, Reid said, ""I don\'t regret that at all."" ""Romney didn\'t win, did he?"" Reid asked rhetorically. As much as he irked Republicans, he was often cheered by Democrats for being the last line of defense to Bush and other Republicans. He was a staunch defender of social programs and, reflecting wishes of the large Latino community back home, a proponent of immigration reform.  Reid shepherded the centerpieces of Obama\'s liberal political legacy into law, and he said one of his proudest accomplishments had been encouraging then-Sen. Obama to run for president.  ""I did call him into my office and told him he should take a look at it. And he was stunned because I was the first one that ever suggested that to him,"" Reid told CNN in 2015.  ""When he was reelected, (that was) one of the most moving phone calls I\'ve ever received because he said, you know, \'You\'re the reason I\'m here,\'"" Reid recalled. Obama reiterated that sentiment in the letter he sent to Reid released Tuesday evening. ""Here\'s what I want you to know. You were a great leader in the Senate, and early on you were more generous to me than I had any right to expect,"" Obama wrote.""As different as we are, I think we both saw something of ourselves in each other - a couple of outsiders who had defied the odds and knew how to take a punch and cared about the little guy. And you know what, we made for a pretty good team,"" he added.Former President Bill Clinton also lauded Reid, remembering him as ""one of the most effective Senate leaders our country has ever known.""""We will likely never see another public servant quite like him—in personality, command of strategy and tactics, and assuredness in marching to the beat of his own drum,"" Clinton said in a statement.In the darkest hours of the Great Recession, Reid ushered a nearly $800 billion economic stimulus plan through the Senate despite insurmountable rows with most Republicans, who said it was too expensive and racked up too much debt.  Later, he piloted the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, through the Senate using a controversial budget maneuver known as reconciliation to bypass a Republican filibuster, and he told the GOP to ""stop crying"" about it.  ""Senator Harry Reid was a leader of immense courage and ferocious conviction who worked tirelessly to achieve historic progress for the American people,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who, as the House\'s top Democrat for the last 20 years, worked with Reid across the Capitol. ""Over more than four decades of public service, Senator Reid was guided always by his North Star: to improve the lives of working families like his own,"" she added in a statement reflecting on his death. In modern-day Washington, the former senator\'s impact is perhaps most present in his 2013 change to the Senate rules to prevent filibusters of most executive branch nominations. He told CNN last year that he ""absolutely"" doesn\'t regret changing the rules at the time, saying: ""I have no regret. It was the right thing to do. And by the way, it\'s not the first time the rules have been changed. They\'ve been changed lots of times. It was time to do it again.""  Broad use of the filibuster has soared in recent years in an increasingly polarized Congress. The shift prompted Reid to pen an opinion piece in the New York Times in 2019 calling for an end to the filibuster altogether.  ""During the two decades we served together in the United States Senate, and the eight years we worked together while I served as Vice President, Harry met the marker for what I\'ve always believed is the most important thing by which you can measure a person—their action and their word,"" Biden said in his Tuesday statement.""If Harry said he would do something, he did it. If he gave you his word, you could bank on it. That\'s how he got things done for the good of the country for decades,"" the President added.Despite his blunt political style, Reid inspired fierce respect from many of his longtime aides, as well as fellow lawmakers -- even those across the aisle.  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who was frequently at odds with Reid during their lengthy careers, remembered him as a ""one-of-a-kind"" senator, saying their relationship had transcended political fights.""The nature of Harry\'s and my jobs brought us into frequent and sometimes intense conflict over politics and policy. But I never doubted that Harry was always doing what he earnestly, deeply felt was right for Nevada and our country,"" the Kentucky Republican said. ""He will rightly go down in history as a crucial, pivotal figure in the development and history of his beloved home state.""Reid told CNN earlier this year that he has ""a lot of respect"" for John Boehner, the former Republican House speaker from Ohio with whom he sparred for years, as he reacted to excerpts of Boehner\'s memoir and lambasted the Republican Party\'s more recent ""tribal"" turn.   ""The deal is this. John Boehner and I got a lot done, but we didn\'t mince words,"" he said.  Love and legacy Despite Reid\'s reputation as a hard bargainer with no qualms about scrapping with his opponents, he was also known as a romantic and the most influential person in his life was his wife, Landra. The two met in high school when Reid was 15. Her father was so opposed to the two dating that Reid and his would-be father-in-law got into a fist fight early in their courtship. Reid, who was raised agnostic, told Bash in 2015 that their opposition was that they wanted their daughter to marry someone Jewish. They eloped in 1959 during college, converting to Mormonism a year later. Her parents finally came around on him. ""I am a blessed man to have this 5-foot tall woman with me all these years,"" said Reid.  The former Senate majority leader credited one thing for his political success over the years: Hard work.  ""I didn\'t make it in life because of my athletic prowess. I didn\'t make it because of my good looks. I didn\'t make it because I\'m a genius,"" he said in his farewell address on the Senate floor in 2016. ""I made it because I worked hard.""  Reid\'s most lasting legacy is likely to be felt in Nevada, where the senator not only remade the Western state, but turned it into a Democratic stronghold that last backed a Republican president in 2004.  ""The little boy from Searchlight has been able to be part of a changing state of Nevada,"" he said in his farewell address in 2016. Reid was instrumental in pushing Democrats to make Nevada one of the first nominating contests in the country, a move that focused Democratic attention on Nevada and was a catalyst to its leftward shift. He often pushed Democrats to make Nevada even more important, urging the party, because of the state\'s diversity, to move the state before Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states in the nominating process. He also used his power to lift up the careers of younger politicians, like Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, whom the former Senate majority leader recruited to run for his seat when he was retiring in 2016.""Harry Reid was a champion for Nevada, helping preserve our precious environmental treasures, strengthen our rural communities, and build up our great cities,"" Cortez Masto recalled in a statement on Tuesday. ""The American people are better off because of the leadership of Senator Harry Reid.""In recognition of the impact Reid had on Nevada, the Clark County Board of Commissioners voted earlier this year in favor of renaming McCarran International Airport to Harry Reid International Airport. Reid reflected on his life -- and the role he played in changing Nevada -- when he received a lifetime achievement award from the Nevada Democratic Party in 2019. ""It\'s a long way from Searchlight to Washington,"" he said. ""But I didn\'t get there alone. I got there because of you, Nevadans."" This story has been updated with additional information.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN)As President Biden struggles through the roughest patch of his presidency yet -- with his poll numbers in the doldrums and the cornerstone of his Build Back Better legislation in peril -- he can look back at one unalloyed success in his first year. The Senate has confirmed a record number of his nominees to the federal judiciary -- the most of any president at this stage in 40 years -- and at a time when that achievement matters more than ever. In its final days in session for the year, the Senate confirmed 10 district judges, giving Biden a total of 40 confirmations, a tie with Ronald Reagan\'s record. By comparison, the Senate confirmed 18 circuit and district court judges in President Donald Trump\'s first year in office, and 12 in President Barack Obama\'s first year. Biden\'s achievement is especially important at a time when partisanship in the judiciary is nearly as pervasive as it is in the political branches.Republicans learned this lesson before Democrats did. When Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican, was Senate majority leader during the Trump years, he put judicial confirmations at the top of his agenda. Thanks to McConnell, the Senate confirmed 54 appellate judges during Trump\'s one term, just one fewer than Obama appointed in his two terms. McConnell\'s Supreme CourtIn overall numbers, according to Pew Research Center, Trump\'s total of 226 in his single term is below the totals of recent two-term presidents, including Obama (320), George W. Bush (322) and Bill Clinton (367). But according to a Washington Post analysis, Trump appointed the youngest group of judges since at least the start of the 20th century. The average age of his appellate court judges was 47, about five years younger than Obama\'s appellate judges. Since all federal judges enjoy life tenure, Trump created a legacy that would be difficult to reverse.But Biden -- with the crucial assistance of Chuck Schumer, the current Senate majority leader, and Richard Durbin, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee -- has fought back. While the Senate has struggled to move much of Biden\'s legislative agenda, Schumer has filled the time with confirmations, and his fellow Democrats (including the otherwise resistant Joe Manchin and Krysten Sinema) have confirmed every one. Biden\'s judges so far are generally younger and more diverse than even Obama\'s were. For example, according to figures compiled by the American Constitution Society, about 80 percent of Biden\'s judicial nominees have been women, compared to 42 percent for Obama and 24 percent for Trump. About 36 percent of Obama\'s nominees were members of minority groups, compared to about 67 percent for Biden, and 16 percent for Trump. And Biden has drawn from a broader pool of lawyers, too. Obama chose a great many former prosecutors for the bench, Biden has looked to defense lawyers as well. Halfway into his first year, Biden\'s legacy in this regard is formidable already.Read MoreOpinion: Clarence Thomas Is the new Chief Justice Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. has famously asserted that our nation\'s judges are independent of politics and ""dedicated"" to nonpartisanship. ""We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges,"" he said. But in recent years the difference between Democratic and Republican judicial appointees has been vast and growing. This is not because the judges are unethical or partisan hacks (at least most of them), but rather because judicial philosophy and political orientation have rarely been as closely aligned as they are today. Democrats and Republicans simply have different and profound disagreements about what the Constitution means.Consider several recent legal controversies. In October, Robert Pitman, an Obama appointee to the federal district court in Texas, ruled that the state\'s draconian anti-abortion rights law known as SB 8 was unconstitutional. Republican-appointed judges overturned him. Similarly, four Democratic appointees have ruled against Trump\'s effort to prevent Congress from gaining access to executive branch records in the investigation of the January 6 riot at the Capitol: The district court ruling was by an Obama appointee, and it was affirmed by a DC Circuit panel of two Obama judges and one Biden judge. Republican-appointed judges have, in turn, stymied Democratic priorities, as when a three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit rejected the Biden administration\'s vaccine mandate for large employers. The judges were one Reagan and two Trump appointees. Attorney General Merrick Garland, don\'t prosecute Donald Trump Of course, one Trump record that Biden cannot hope to equal involves the most important federal court of all. McConnell\'s most consequential acts as majority leader allowed Trump to fill three seats on the Supreme Court. McConnell forbade consideration of Merrick Garland as a replacement for Antonin Scalia during the last year of Obama\'s presidency, paving the way for Trump to nominate Neil Gorsuch in his inaugural year. He then steered Brett Kavanaugh through a tumultuous confirmation and then jammed through the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett in the waning days of Trump\'s presidency. The Supreme Court is now the most partisan of federal courts, one with a clear conservative majority on such issues as abortion, affirmative action, gun safety and many others. Even if Stephen Breyer, the 83-year-old liberal, retires in the next year and Biden replaces him, the current President cannot reasonably hope to change that lineup in the near future.Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion\'s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookAnd Biden\'s first-term record of judicial accomplishment stands on a fragile base as well. If the Democrats lose even a single Senate seat in the 2022 midterms (as historical trends suggest they will), McConnell will again be majority leader and in a position to bring judicial confirmations to a halt. Certainly, McConnell will not allow Biden to fill a seat on the Supreme Court. That means Biden, along with Schumer and Durbin, will have to keep up the same pace of appointing and confirming judges in the next year if they want a legacy that even Mitch McConnell can\'t undo.', 'Did Joe Manchin just sink Biden\'s plan?

(CNN) With his announcement on ""Fox News Sunday"" that he will not vote for President Joe Biden\'s Build Back Better plan, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) has handed the White House not just a lump of coal this Christmas, but an entire strip mine. Paul Begala The reaction was immediate and fierce. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), the chair of the Senate Budget Committee, blasted his more conservative colleague (but, to be fair, all 99 of Sanders\' colleagues are more conservative than he). Sanders told CNN\'s Jake Tapper that if Manchin ""doesn\'t have the courage to do the right thing for the working families of West Virginia and America, let him vote no in front of the whole world.""   It appears Manchin is prepared to do just that. As a veteran of countless make-or-break moments on Capitol Hill and in the White House, I know that Biden and the Democrats have multiple paths forward. Read More First, I must note that this is not the biggest setback Joe Biden has faced in his life, and each time he has come back stronger. The political graveyards are filled with people who underestimated Joe Biden. Beneath the genial visage is a spine of steel. As Oliver Wendell Holmes said of his fellow Civil War veterans, Biden\'s heart has been ""touched with fire."" It will not break from this blow. Perhaps Manchin is being tactical. Perhaps there is still some version of BBB he can support. If so, his support will brand the bill as moderate -- with a capital M. Not the worst thing going into an election year in which moderate voters in swing districts will decide the outcome.  If, instead, Manchin has pulled the plug on Build Back Better, Biden still has several paths to success: Piecemeal. The size and scope of BBB, which thrilled progressives, may have ultimately sunk it with Manchin. The White House website extolls the virtues of 22 different provisions in BBB. Twenty-two. Woodrow Wilson thought he could remake the world after World War I with just 14 points. And the Good Lord himself thought we could govern ourselves with 10. Biden could break BBB up into those 22 component parts and introduce them separately. Not all will pass, of course, especially since it will take 60 votes to break filibuster, while the BBB requires only 50 votes under reconciliation. Maybe none will, given some Democrats\' absurd fealty to the filibuster. But you never know.  Biden must show Manchin and Sinema he can play hardballWhen my old boss, Bill Clinton, crashed and burned in his attempt to pass national health care, the Comeback Kid came back with the Children\'s Health Insurance Plan, tougher nursing home standards, expanded options for people with breast and cervical cancer, improved food safety, expanded childhood immunizations, a massive increase in medical research funding, and waged war on Big Tobacco. All of those were a far cry from universal health care, but they were progress, and Clinton is a progressive. Even if we fail, Clinton used to say to me, ""there\'s nothin\' wrong with getting caught tryin\'.""Executive Orders. President Barack Obama also came back after a massive setback -- in his case, on immigration. He failed in his attempt to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Then he failed in his attempt to pass the DREAM Act, which would have legalized the status of those who had come to America without papers as young children. Democrats -- on background, of course -- excoriated Obama, telling Newsweek that Obama\'s efforts on immigration were ""a disaster.""  ""I campaigned for him,"" one said. ""I put my reputation on line. He either didn\'t know what he was doing or he lied, because he has not done what he said he would do. I\'m ashamed."" Undeterred by the friendly fire, Obama pressed on. In 2012 he signed an executive order known as DACA -- Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. The order allowed young ""Dreamers"" to legally work in the United States and prohibited their deportation. Take it to the Voters. The news, of course, is all about Manchin. But it is vital for Biden and the Democrats to explain to voters why Manchin has so much power: The reason Biden must get every single Democrat is that the GOP won\'t let him get even a single Republican. How is it that out of 50 Republican senators not one is for a child tax credit -- a middle-class tax cut to help families make ends meet?  Not even one Republican is for making child care more affordable, or home care for your elderly parents and grandparents. Not even one Republican is for universal pre-K, or tax breaks for middle class families who want to buy an electric car or install solar panels on their roof. Not even one Republican is for negotiating for cheaper prescription drugs in Medicare, or for lower premiums under Obamacare, or for covering hearing aids under Medicare. Not even one Republican wants to expand a tax credit that rewards people who choose work over welfare -- an idea that Ronald Reagan championed. Not even one Republican is for more affordable housing, or better nutrition for children. Biden should tell his fellow Americans that he wouldn\'t even need Joe Manchin if he could get a few Republicans to actually stand up for work, for middle-class tax cuts, for green jobs. Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion\'s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook I believe the reason Biden and his fellow Democrats are in this position is because the Trumpist Republicans seem to lie awake at night, unable to sleep for the fear that somewhere, someone is living the American Dream.  Needless to say, none of these options is attractive. Each has a serious risk of failure. But with the planet warming and his party\'s political prospects cooling; with COVID resurging and Trump resurfacing; with prices going up and polls going down, Biden\'s only option is to get caught tryin\'.', 'Democrats walk on eggshells around Breyer as GOP plans another blockade for any Biden Supreme Court pickBy Edward-Isaac Dovere and Manu Raju, CNNUpdated 6:36 PM ET, Sun December 19, 2021 JUST WATCHEDJustice Breyer: \'It\'s important not to have transparency\'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH (17 Videos)Justice Breyer: \'It\'s important not to have transparency\'\'Shameless\': Avlon reacts to McCarthy\'s press conferenceSee the messages Oath Keepers leader sent to followersDOJ files rarely-used \'seditious conspiracy\' charges against January 6 defendants Why the Supreme Court decided against vaccine mandateHear why Sinema is concerned about eliminating filibusterThe case against a 2024 Hillary Clinton candidacy Senator says he\'s \'glad\' Biden went a \'little too far\' in voting rights speechHear how McCarthy\'s words on 1/6 have changed in a year\'Extraordinarily painful to watch\': GOP senator under fire for remarks about Black judicial nomineeEfforts to reform 19th century law could decide who is president in 2024Lindsey Graham picks side in Trump vs. McConnell divideCNN reporter explains what GOP is plotting if they win majority\'It looks bleak, honestly\': Gloria Borger on Biden\'s push to pass voting rights billsFauci calls Republican senator a \'moron\' under his breath during tense hearingReporter explains why McConnell isn\'t talking about TrumpTrump attacks McConnell in new interview (CNN)Senate Republicans are poised to deny President Joe Biden an appointment to the Supreme Court if they take the majority in the 2022 midterm elections. Five Republican senators raised the stakes around Justice Stephen Breyer\'s retirement, telling CNN they\'d oppose any likely nominee out of this White House. But Democrats in the Senate and the White House, though they\'ve come off the November elections more worried in recent weeks about a potential wipeout in the midterms, are still avoiding calling directly for Breyer to quit, fearing that it would backfire and encourage the 83-year-old to stay on the bench.Breyer has told several people who\'ve made unofficial efforts to push him to retire that he thinks the confirmation process shouldn\'t be political, according to people told of those discussions, and Democrats worry he\'d remain as an act of resistance to show he\'s not bowing to politics.Still, top Democrats across Washington would like Breyer to announce he\'s going even before the end of the court term in June, so they can get moving on confirmation hearings well before the midterms. More than the political calendar is on their minds -- with their 50-50 margin and several aging Senate Democrats coming from states with Republican governors, they head into the new year fearing that their control of the chamber could collapse at any moment. Read MoreStephen Breyer says now isn\'t the time to lose faith in the Supreme CourtPrivately, multiple Senate Democrats complain that Breyer seems to have let his ego overtake him and he is not being realistic to how radically Supreme Court confirmation politics has changed in the last five years. Publicly, they continue to approach Breyer gingerly. Asked if the 50-50 Senate divide, the health of his colleagues and Breyer\'s own health should accelerate the justice\'s timeline, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse chose his words carefully, noting that he\'d deliberately avoided calling for Breyer\'s retirement. ""I would hope,"" the Rhode Island Democrat finally said, ""the choice and its consequences are apparent to the justice.""And the White House is stuck in the middle, with the President adamant that Breyer should get to make his own decision.Biden has so far avoided the kind of pressure that Barack Obama tried to exert on Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2013, when the President hosted the aging justice at the White House for lunch to nudge her toward the exit. But in the West Wing and among civil rights leaders, the frustration is about more than just a Supreme Court seat: every day that Breyer remains on the bench is a day that Biden isn\'t able to fulfill his campaign pledge to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court. Members of the Supreme Court pose for a group photo in April. There are also the political considerations, with Democrats eager to excite their base ahead of next year\'s elections.  ""The President made a bold commitment,"" said National Urban League President Marc Morial. ""I hope it would add to the thinking to make that kind of history."" Republicans ready for replay of Merrick Garland pickMeanwhile, Senate Republicans aren\'t shy about laying out how they\'d handle a nomination from Biden if they take the majority: They wouldn\'t.""You know what the rule is on that,"" said Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee. ""You go back to 1886 and ever since then, when the Senate\'s been of one party and the president\'s been of another party, you didn\'t confirm.""There is no such rule.Senate Republicans have invoked a number of what they call ""rules"" in recent years to explain, for example, refusing to hold confirmation hearings for Merrick Garland, the now-attorney general who was Obama\'s choice to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, or their rushing to confirm Justice Amy Coney Barrett, President Donald Trump\'s choice to replace Ginsburg. But the then-Democratic majority Senate voted to confirm President Ronald Reagan\'s nomination of Anthony Kennedy in 1988 and President George H.W. Bush\'s nomination of David Souter in 1990 and Clarence Thomas in 1991, all while Grassley was in the Senate. Back then, the Judiciary Committee chairman was a senator from Delaware named Joe Biden.While Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has sought to downplay this talk -- ""I\'m not going to start talking about what might happen if I\'m the majority leader,"" he said last week when asked about Supreme Court nominations -- he was the mastermind of the GOP efforts to upend the confirmation process to seize seats. And many of his members were more willing to discuss where this is headed, particularly if the seat were to come open in 2023 or 2024, when they would use being in a presidential election cycle to make a similar justification for stonewalling a pick as McConnell did in 2016.Then-President Barack Obama joins then-Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland during his nomination announcement in March 2016. ""Constitutionally, the Senate has an obligation to advise and consent. The Senate can take up nominations when it wants to,"" said GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. Not that most Republicans could imagine supporting a Biden nominee at any point.""Given the pattern of judicial nominees he\'s put forward so far, he keeps being captive to the radical left in his party. If he nominated a radical leftist justice who would ignore the rule of law and undermine our constitutional rights, I can\'t imagine a Republican Senate would confirm an extreme justice,"" said Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Sen. Thom Tillis, a member of the Judiciary Committee, said Republicans would make a choice if they didn\'t like a Biden pick: ""Either don\'t move on him or have him fail in committee.""""It\'s not our intention to rubber stamp nominees,"" the North Carolina Republican said.  McConnell\'s Supreme CourtSen. John Cornyn, who sits on the committee but also is a member of leadership, said how the GOP would act on a nominee depends on when a vacancy would occur.""Usually if we are in the majority and Biden is still in office, what that produces is a negotiation,"" the Texas Republican said. ""I haven\'t really thought about filing the vacancy or not, so I think a lot of that has to do when in that two years of time it occurs.""Cornyn added: ""The later it occurs in his term, the less likely it will be; the earlier, more likely.""Sens. John Kennedy of Louisiana and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, both Judiciary Committee members, declined to comment on whether they\'d be willing to consider a Biden nominee for the Supreme Court. When asked if there\'s a Biden nominee he could envision supporting, Cotton suppressed a chuckle. Democrats scramble for a responseDemocrats have struggled to respond to Republicans\' escalation of Supreme Court partisan warfare. Many who presume Breyer will announce that he\'s retiring in June also presumed he was going to announce he\'d quit this past June. He\'s been on the court since 1994, confirmed a few months before the massive Republican wave in that year\'s midterms, and is quickly moving up the ranks of the longest serving justices ever (he\'s currently at No. 23).  ""I\'m deeply concerned,"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who\'s a member of the Judiciary Committee, said when asked about a Breyer retirement in a GOP majority. ""In effect, the threat of Republican control in the Senate is a dagger aimed at the heart of the Supreme Court, which would be potentially out of balance and out of the mainstream if there are more right-wing ideologues appointed.""Blumenthal said he is not urging Breyer to retire but added: ""I\'m just hoping he assesses as strategically and intelligently as I know he will do ... the potential dangers of a GOP majority."" Justice Stephen Breyer speaks during an interview on ""The David Rubenstein Show"" in New York, in September. In public interviews in recent months, Breyer has also downplayed America\'s current divisions, arguing the country has survived other tough times in the past.Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, often talks to colleagues about how they\'re ""a heartbeat"" away from the minority with the current 50-50 Senate. Privately, multiple Democratic senators acknowledge that -- with seven of their members over age 70 coming from states with Republican governors who\'d get to appoint replacements -- they worry how right, literally, he\'ll turn out to be. Those senators include Sens. Bernie Sanders and Patrick Leahy from Vermont, who are both over 80 and have been suddenly hospitalized in recent years -- Sanders for his heart attack in October 2019 and Leahy for feeling ""unwell"" last January. ""Absolutely,"" said Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, when asked if it were a real worry when looking around at the number of his aging colleagues from states with Republican governors. ""No question about it."" A spokesman for Leahy, who as the then-Judiciary Committee chairman tried to encourage Ginsburg to step down before Obama invited her to lunch to ramp up the pressure, didn\'t respond to an emailed question about whether the senator thinks Breyer should step down now. But Leahy\'s announcement last month that he won\'t seek another term has only increased anxiety about his health among colleagues.  Not only did Republicans seize the opportunities created by Scalia\'s and Ginsburg\'s deaths, but Trump\'s White House counsel carefully worked Kennedy to retire on their timeline ahead of the 2018 midterms, assuring him that he\'d want to guarantee that another conservative took his spot. The secret Supreme Court: Late nights, courtesy votes and the unwritten 6-vote rule ""Clearly the examples of Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kennedy put in very plain relief what the difference can be for the make-up of the court,"" said Whitehouse, the Rhode Island Democrat who\'s become a leading voice for changes at the Supreme Court. ""Breyer may pine for a time that never was -- a fantasy era when judicial selection wasn\'t political,"" said Robert Raben, an assistant attorney general in the Clinton administration who has since become an advocate for increasing diversity on the bench. ""That\'s a chimera, and we on the left need to accept the fact that if you\'re assigned a bill number and marked up in a committee, it\'s politics.""Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar told CNN over the summer that she hoped Breyer would retire ""sooner rather than later."" Those feelings have spread and intensified among her colleagues in the months since, and Senate Democratic leaders have already had preliminary discussions about how they would conduct a confirmation process, according to people involved.A close eye on Breyer When Breyer sat for a round of interviews this summer to promote his new book, White House aides carefully parsed his answers about potential retirement, including when he told CNN that both his health and his new position as the court\'s senior liberal would weigh on his thinking. Later he expanded further to the New York Times, saying he would factor in who was choosing his successor when making a decision about stepping down.Justice Breyer says return to in-person Supreme Court arguments is a \'big improvement\'The comments led to rounds of speculation among some Biden advisers of what Breyer\'s intentions really were as it became clear the justice would not retire ahead of this year\'s term. Some viewed the comments as a sign he was taking into consideration the make up of the Senate.Asked in October about calls for him to retire while the Democrats were secure in their Senate majority, Breyer told CNN, ""That\'s their point of view,"" adding, ""I think I have most of the considerations in mind. I simply have to weigh them and think about them and decide when the proper time is."" Breyer said he does not want to die on the court. Presented with the history of previous justices giving early word of their retirements to presidents, Breyer said, ""I\'ve looked through the various practices."" In some years, justices who are planning to retire at the end of the term have told the president several months ahead of time.Still, among many Democrats close to and inside the White House, Breyer\'s decision to remain on the bench this year was a serious disappointment. Inside the White House, the prospect of a Breyer retirement has been simmering underneath the surface since nearly the moment Biden took office. Among other factors, it\'s hard to press an 83-year-old justice to retire when Biden says he\'s planning to run for reelection when he will be in his early 80s himself. Then-Supreme Court Justice nominee Stephen Breyer meets with then-Sen. Joe Biden meet in Biden\'s office on Capitol Hill in May 1994.Various candidates to replace Breyer have been suggested to Dana Remus, the White House counsel, by Democrats close to Biden, who are eager to put forward names. Biden allies have also approached Vice President Kamala Harris and members of her team with candidates. There\'s even been outside rumor mongering that Biden could appoint Harris.Among members of Biden\'s senior team, at least one maintains a close connection to Breyer: national security adviser Jake Sullivan, who clerked for the justice in the early 2000s. Sullivan\'s wife, Maggie Goodlander, also clerked for Breyer three years ago and Breyer attended their wedding on the campus of Yale Law School in 2015. White House chief of staff Ron Klain, who was a top Senate Judiciary Committee staffer under Biden and has been hyper-focused on judicial nominations since the beginning of this presidency, has a decades-long friendship with Justice Elena Kagan, one Breyer\'s few fellow liberals still on the court. Thinking back on that lunch attempting to nudge Ginsburg in 2013, several Obama aides note that the former President turned out to be justified in his interest in seeing her retire while Democrats had the majority. Biden has insisted on a more hands-off approach to Breyer. ""The President\'s view is that any considerations about potential retirements are solely and entirely up to justices themselves,"" said White House spokesman Andrew Bates. Anxiety about potential backfire from pushing Breyer to retire also comes up often in discussions with top West Wing aides, according to several who\'ve had those conversation. Most of the speculation on a potential pick focuses on Ketanji Brown Jackson, confirmed this spring for the DC circuit court of appeals, a traditional feeder for the Supreme Court. A former Breyer clerk, she has already been vetted by the Biden team and interviewed by the President and has been supported in the past by former House Speaker Paul Ryan, a prominent Republican who is related to her by marriage.California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger is also discussed. She is seen as helped by being well liked among the alumni of the solicitor general\'s office, where she was a top official in the Obama administration. She has not, however, been as thoroughly vetted. Biden Supreme Court commission\'s draft report details \'profound\' disagreement over adding seats to benchOther names currently circulating: Minnesota district court Judge Mimi Wright, outgoing NAACP Legal Defense Fund President Sherrilyn Ifill, Second Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Eunice Lee, Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Candace Jackson-Akiwumi, and J. Michelle Childs, a South Carolina judge who\'s been pushed by House Majority Whip James Clyburn and whose nomination is currently pending for a Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals seat. Clyburn, notably, gave Biden the endorsement that helped salvage his campaign in the 2020 primaries after getting him to promise to appoint a Black woman.  Clyburn, who has previously said he didn\'t think it was his place to call for Breyer\'s retirement (and who\'s 81 himself), is sticking by that position, according to an aide.Process becomes a problemEven if Breyer announces his retirement in the spring and they\'re still in the majority, Democratic senators and top aides on Capitol Hill worry about how long confirmation could take, between the regular order of the process and expected GOP efforts to slow it down. Republicans ""use power maximally especially as it relates to the judiciary, and I think we should expect nothing different going forward,"" said Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii.  And, as with everything these days, Democrats worry about securing votes from Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.The current Supreme Court\'s partisan moment rivals Bush v. GoreRepublicans have also proven much more adept at activating their base voters around Supreme Court confirmations, whether when Scalia\'s seat was in the balance in the 2016 elections, when Brett Kavanaugh\'s confirmation hearings exploded ahead of the 2018 elections or when Barrett was rushed onto the bench ahead of the 2020 elections. Democrats warn against thinking that they\'d be the ones who would benefit politically from a retirement ahead of an election, even with a historic pick and potentially momentous abortion ruling motivating their base. The threat to Roe. v. Wade is another reason why they want Breyer to announce he\'s leaving ahead of schedule.""Securing the seat is more important than trying to be cute about the timing for some midterm impact,"" said Brian Fallon, the executive director of Demand Justice, a Democratic group focused on judicial nominations. In 2016, McConnell\'s refusal to at least give confirmation hearings to Obama\'s nominee left the seat open for almost a year, enraging Senate Democrats and making several of his own Republican members deeply uncomfortable. Republicans say they\'re now ready to leave a seat open for years, if that\'s what it would take to wait out a Democrat in the White House. And the stakes could get even higher, if future election challenges make their way to the Supreme Court, which would have an even number of justices if Breyer is no longer in his spot. Sen. Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican who doesn\'t sit on the committee, believes it\'s ""unlikely"" Republicans would keep a seat vacant for two years.""I would presume we\'d go for the hearings and make a decision,"" Romney said. ""By the way, we might vote no, but we might as well have a hearing and make a decision.""  Multiple Republican senators say they\'d rather avoid the kind of showdown that a retirement would set off in a GOP majority, or in a presidential election year -- or both.""If he\'s going to retire, he needs to retire next year,"" said South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, the former Judiciary Committee chairman. ""It would be a lot easier.""Joan Biskupic and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report. ']"
