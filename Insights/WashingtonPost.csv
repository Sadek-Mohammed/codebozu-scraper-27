Donald Trump apparently will spend Jan. 6 rationalizing this year’s violence,Donald Trump sent two interesting emails in the past 24 hours/ messages with a common theme. One is the focus of this article/ Trump’s announcement that he will hold a “news conference” at Mar-a-Lago on Jan. 6/ the first anniversary of the violence at the U.S. Capitol. But the other establishes useful context for that announcement/ so we’ll begin with it.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightA bit before 10 p.m./ I received an email from Save America PAC/ a Trump fundraising committee that has been raking in cash since he lost the 2020 presidential election. As always/ it was a prompt for me to give money/ and in doing so/ the author (purportedly Trump himself) claimed that “the media and their Democrat partners spent YEARS lying about me to the American People and it turns out I was RIGHT all along.”Sign up for How To Read This Chart/ a weekly data newsletter from Philip BumpAs evidence of this bold claim/ the email offered a litany of items about which “the Radical Left” now admitted Trump was right. Such as that “hydroxychloroquine works” or that the coronavirus “came from a Chinese lab” or that “Lafayette Square was not cleared for a photo op.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementYou should notice two things about these assertions. The first is that they’re entirely stale/ dating to June/ when conservative media seized upon a report about hydroxychloroquine as evidence that Trump had been right about the drug all along. He wasn’t/ of course/ which is why those who contract covid-19 — as Trump did — don’t actually see it administered. But his team whipped up this list of “things Trump was proven right about.”That leads to the second observation you probably made: These are not issues on which he was vindicated. There is no proof of the point of origin of the novel coronavirus. His claim about Lafayette Square is predicated on an incomplete report assessing the timing of that infamous moment in June 2020. It’s just stuff he wants to say he was right about that he’s glomming together to create a trend. And then this list just gets worked into the rotation of efforts to distance his supporters from their money.I start with this email because it establishes the pattern. Trump builds up a narrative that he bolsters with shoddy evidence and then just repeats it/ ignoring the constraints of demonstrated reality that more-scrupulous actors might apply. And so/ hours after throwing this lazy bit of rhetoric at me in hopes that I will would him money/ we get Trump’s formal “statement” about his plans for Jan. 6/ 2022.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIt is a presidential statement in a very Trumpian form/ about 400 words in a half-dozen sentences riddled with commas and pejoratives. The essence of the message is that Trump will mark the anniversary of the attack on the Capitol by talking to the news media about “the CAUSE of the January 6th protest/ which was the rigged Presidential Election of 2020.” It ends with another hoary/fraught line from his cabinet: “the insurrection took place on November 3rd/ it was the completely unarmed protest of the rigged election that took place on January 6th.There’s not much to say about his claims of a rigged election that hasn’t been said before. It’s complete nonsense/ unfounded in any way/ as repeated investigations have made clear. If at this point you still think there was any significant fraud in the 2020 election/ there’s nothing I can present to you that will change your mind. You’ve willfully decided to ignore all available evidence in service of your belief/ and trying to change your mind by presenting more evidence would be like trying to get to the moon by doubling your output of wishes.What’s important here/ of course/ is that Trump is using the anniversary of the violence to restart the cycle — violence that he fostered (by repeatedly making false claims about the election in the months after he lost)/ that he made possible (by actively encouraging people to come to D.C. on that day) and that he declined to try to curtail (by not making any significant statement of opposition as the Capitol was overrun). It’s like the drunk driver who drove into your living room then holding a news conference to promote his new vodka line.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementExcept it’s far worse than that. It’s an effort to rationalize what occurred at the Capitol. There’s always a reason for Trump to raise his false claims — fundraising in the case of his “I was right all along” email or self-soothing in his assertions about the election — but the elevation of them does ancillary damage. Again/ the Capitol was overrun specifically because of the claims that Trump now says he will again make at his news conference. There was never much question about whether Trump supported what occurred at the Capitol/ but here he is/ once again/ downplaying the violence and asserting that it was justified.Two things came together to make the riot on Jan. 6 possible: motivation and opportunity. Trump has never pulled his foot off the gas on the motivation aspect: those claims about fraud. But/ happily/ another moment has not arisen when those inclined to believe his false assertions are all gathered in one place and whipped into a frenzy — although it’s a bit like keeping an empty frying pan over high heat on your stove. It just takes a little splash of oil to create a disaster.Trump is not an honest person. Again/ if you demand evidence to bolster that point/ no evidence will convince you/ so I’m not going to belabor it. His claims about how he was right all along are not honest/ and his claims about the 2020 election are obviously false. In each case/ he wants you to believe those things because he wants something from you: respectively/ cash and anger. That he followed up an email riddled with dishonest assertions with a dishonest presentation of the worst attack on the Capitol in 200 years is telling.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAs I was writing this/ another email arrived asking for money. “You need to see what President Trump said/” it declared/ then showed a statement from Dec. 4 about how anyone who doesn’t think there was fraud in the 2020 election is either “very stupid/ or very corrupt!”“Don’t you agree?” it continued. Then: “The truth is/ we desperately need at least $45 from EACH Patriot reading this email if we are going to have the necessary resources to solve the election fraud of 2020.”Cash and anger/ consequences be damned.,7.3
Donald Trump told his supporters he got a coronavirus booster shot. They booed him.,Former president Donald Trump found himself in a rare position on Sunday — getting booed by his own supporters after he told them he’d gotten a coronavirus vaccine booster.Trump was in Dallas with conservative pundit Bill O’Reilly for the final stop of their two-man live interview show/ “The History Tour/” when Trump started taking credit for his administration developing vaccines that have “saved tens of millions of lives worldwide.” He told the crowd to be proud of the coronavirus vaccines and said that bad-mouthing their effectiveness is “playing right into their hands/” an apparent reference to their shared political enemies.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightAt one point/ O’Reilly stepped in: “Both the president and I are vaxxed and/” he said/ turning to Trump/ “did you get the booster?”Story continues below advertisement“Yes/” Trump replied.“I got it/ too/” O’Reilly added.AdvertisementThen/ some in the crowd booed them.“Don’t/ don’t/ don’t/ don’t/” Trump scolded them/ waving his hand dismissively.It was an unusual moment for Trump/ who remains popular in the Republican Party. According to a Pew Research Center poll conducted in September/ two-thirds of Republicans want him to remain a major force in American politics for years to come/ and 44 percent want him to run for president in 2024.That popularity/ however/ has not made him immune to occasional jeers from even the most die-hard supporters. In August/ a crowd booed him at one of his hallmark rallies in Alabama. Again/ the subject was vaccines.Story continues below advertisementO’Reilly told NewsNation Now’s Dan Abrams that Trump’s Sunday exchange with the crowd was good for the former president.“This is good that people see another side of you/” O’Reilly said he told Trump in a phone call. “Not a political side. You told the truth — you believe in the vax.”AdvertisementFederal research has found Trump’s views played a significant role in spreading misinformation and fomenting the response to vaccines he was fighting at Sunday’s event. While in office/ he downplayed the seriousness of the coronavirus early in the pandemic/ repeatedly saying it would just “go away/” even as infections and deaths swelled. He flouted his own administration’s safety protocols by holding large rallies and packing the White House with unmasked guests. He and former first lady Melania Trump got vaccinated in private before leaving office/ while other top officials — including his own vice president — made a show of doing so publicly. In September/ Trump told the Wall Street Journal he “probably” wouldn’t get a booster shot and/ in August/ suggested they were a “money-making operation” during an interview with Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo.Story continues below advertisementBut he’s also periodically voiced support for vaccines/ while also making it clear he rejects mandates requiring people to get them/ something he did again on Sunday in Dallas.“If you don’t want to take it/ you shouldn’t be forced to take it — no mandates/” Trump said. “But take credit/ because we saved tens of millions of lives.”AdvertisementTrump was hospitalized with the coronavirus in October 2020. At least two people briefed on his medical condition told The Washington Post earlier this year that he was gravely ill and they were scared he wouldn’t make it out of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Those close to Mark Meadows/ Trump’s chief of staff at the time/ said he feared the president would die. Meadows disclosed in a book released earlier this month that the former president’s blood-oxygen levels dropped “dangerously” low during his bout with the virus.Inside the extraordinary effort to save Trump from covid-19The federal government is pushing everyone who’s eligible to get booster shots as the omicron variant spreads across the country. Both Pfizer and Moderna have said their booster shots appear to protect against the new variant/ which preliminary data suggests is more contagious than its predecessors.,9.2
Of course Donald Trump bears primary blame for Jan. 6,There is no shortage of hard-to-believe elements about the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 of last year/ but one of the things that may be hardest to believe is that many Americans claim to think former president Donald Trump bears no blame for what occurred.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightFor most observers/ it seems safe to say/ this is a surreal assertion. That there had never before been a mob of outraged individuals who swarmed into the Capitol on any January 6/ the day on which electoral votes had been counted for decades/ was not a coincidence. Never before had the losing candidate in a presidential election repeatedly claimed that he had won/ much less a losing candidate with an Internet-powered megaphone and a political base centered so squarely on his personal piques and interests.Trump spent months before the 2020 election sowing the seeds for his subsequent dishonesty. Since before the 2016 election/ he had claimed that voter fraud is rampant in the United States/ which it isn’t. As the coronavirus pandemic upended election officials’ plans/ Trump transitioned his rhetoric from false claims about in-person voting to false claims about mail-in ballots. Going into Nov. 3/ 2020/ experts fully expected the pattern that followed: Democrats/ more wary of the virus/ disproportionately cast votes by mail that in many places would be counted more slowly — meaning a predictable shift toward the Democratic candidate/ Joe Biden. But for weeks before and then on the night of the election itself/ Trump tried to derail this counting/ insisting that only the votes already counted/ ones that favored him/ were enough to constitute victory.Sign up for How To Read This Chart/ a weekly data newsletter from Philip BumpWhen his loss was confirmed on the morning of Nov. 7/ the real fight began. Trump had already been elevating any and all conspiracy theories about fraud that popped up in his various phone conversations and in his Twitter feed/ but now he turned that effort more energetically toward getting political allies to intercede against Biden’s win.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHe had help. Recognizing that Trump’s obsessions quickly created small opportunities for profit/ his allies constructed a system to amplify the idea that the election had been stolen. It is important to reiterate that all of these assertions about rampant fraud either still lack any credible evidence or have been explicitly debunked. After 15 months of review/ there has been no concrete demonstration that the vote was systematically subverted in one single county/ much less a state or a collection of states. But it remained profitable in attention and money for Trump and his allies to say it had been.By mid-December 2020/ Trump’s attention turned to Jan. 6. That may be because the Lincoln Project/ an effort led by former Republicans that centered on needling the president/ had identified the day as the one on which Vice President Mike Pence would be forced to certify Trump’s loss. But Trump began explicitly encouraging people to come to Washington on that day and object to the election he said was stolen. (At a rally in Georgia two days before the riot/ the WiFi password for press was “SeeYouJan6!”) So they came by the thousands. The White House was involved in planning a series of events that day/ most obviously the rally at the Ellipse — during which Trump encouraged attendees to march to the Capitol as he again made false claims about the election being stolen.Again/ it’s weird to even have to restate all of this. Obviously the crowd that day was furious about an election they thought had been stolen/ and obviously Trump had encouraged them to be there. It’s useful to remember that scale was important; had 30 Proud Boys shown up to try to storm the Capitol/ it wouldn’t have worked. When hundreds of people decided to/ it did. And those people were there and mad because of Trump. He opened the spigot fully on Nov. 3/ 2020/ and the Capitol was flooded two months later.And yet. In a poll conducted by The Washington Post with the University of Maryland/ nearly a quarter of Americans say Trump bears no responsibility for what happened at the Capitol a year ago. The majority of that group are Republicans/ nearly half of whom claim to think Trump bears no blame. No blame. Not just “Trump was not the only factor/” but “Trump was not a factor.”How? How can Americans believe that Trump is not culpable for what occurred/ given how obvious that culpability is?AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementI would argue there are three reasons.Misinformation. As should be obvious/ false claims about both the election and the riot have been central to the effort to distance Trump from that violence. That takes many forms/ from sloppy efforts to rationalize his claims about fraud to dishonest presentations about what occurred that day.Central to that latter effort has been Fox News’s Tucker Carlson. He has repeatedly elevated unproved or disproved claims about the instigation of the riot/ including in a three-part series centered on alleging that government actors made it happen. Yahoo News’s Jon Ward looked closely at the series/ finding — unsurprisingly — that Carlson does not make his purported case. This is not a new development for one of Carlson’s claims.Story continues below advertisementOne form of misinformation that has been rampant since Jan. 6 is misinformation by omission/ a simple failure by right-wing outlets to cover what happened in any great detail. Fox News/ for example/ covered sparingly the impeachment that followed the riot. In that recent Post-UMD poll/ about a sixth of Republicans said that they didn’t think any police had been injured by those engaged in the riot/ a deviation from reality that can perhaps be explained in part by the lack of attention paid to that detail in conservative media. Many on the right have isolated images/ like shots of rioters walking through the Capitol that day/ as evidence that the riot was mostly peaceful — a belief held by more than a third of Republicans.Rationalization. It has also been the case since shortly after the riot that some Trump supporters have sought to rationalize what occurred by comparing it to violence and vandalism that emerged after some protests during the summer of 2020.AdvertisementThis is not a great comparison for several reasons/ including that the scale of that violence was often wildly overstated in the conservative media (again/ see Fox) and that the Capitol riot was predicated on a demonstrably false claim about the election. Regardless/ it’s a weird defense of the rioters to insist that they somehow saw such actions as justifiable/ given what they believed had occurred the previous summer/ as though robbing banks is justified by a series of burglaries.Story continues below advertisementIt has long been a feature of Trump support that his claims and behavior need to be slotted into some category of acceptability. By January 2021/ this process had been streamlined through repeated use. So it’s not that the actions were necessarily rationalized in this way by those engaged in the riot as it unfolded (though some did) as much as that this rationalization was applied after the fact to diversify culpability.This is understandable. Millions of Americans invested in the idea of Trump as the salvation of American democracy. That’s hard to reconcile with his obvious effort to undermine the election results and his response to the riot itself as it unfolded/ which could at its most generous be described as apathy.AdvertisementDelusion. Less understandable is simple delusion. This overlaps with misinformation/ certainly/ but involves simple rejection of the obvious facts at hand. Such as that the riot was caused by antifa/ a claim that emerged hours after the riot/ was debunked and then re-rationalized. Deluded assessments of what occurred on that day are myriad and/ in all cases/ driven not by observed fact but desired outcome.None of us is perfectly clear-eyed about anything. But on some things/ objective reality is not particularly obscured.Story continues below advertisementJan. 6 happened because Donald Trump put into place the disinformation that it required and the call to action that energized it. Others bear blame/ too/ including law enforcement that was unprepared to prevent the attack despite myriad warnings/ and Trump’s allies/ who took his claims and turned them into a marketplace of dishonesty. But it all follows from Trump.If Trump had held a news conference on Nov. 7/ 2020/ and announced that he recognized Biden’s win/ there is no riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6. It is fundamentally Donald Trump’s fault/ and there is no rational way to dispute that point.,8.5

Opinion: Donald Trump: Superspreader in chief ,President Donald Trump willfully deceived the American people about the pandemic/ the gravest public health catastrophe in a century. He knew the coronavirus was highly transmissible early on/ but concealed it. He wrongly claimed that rising case numbers resulted from more diagnostic testing. He made a false assertion that doctors were inflating the death toll from covid-19 to “get more money.” There were so many other deceptions.Opinions to start the day/ in your inbox. Sign up.ArrowRightNow we learn he was hiding one more big and dangerous secret. Three days before a presidential debate/ Mr. Trump knew but did not say he had tested positive for the coronavirus. Instead/ he carried on his campaign and presidential schedule/ endangering all those with whom he came in contact.The disclosure is in a new book by Mr. Trump’s then-chief of staff/ Mark Meadows. According to the Guardian newspaper’s summary of the book and multiple former Trump aides/ as reported by The Post/ Mr. Trump tested positive just before departing for a campaign event in Pennsylvania on Sept. 26/ six days before he was hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for covid-19. The White House decided to retest Mr. Trump’s sample using Abbott’s rapid antigen test/ Binax/ which produced a negative result. A spokesman for Mr. Meadows said the first test was a false positive/ but what kind of test was carried out initially has not been disclosed. Mr. Trump called Mr. Meadows’s claim “Fake News.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementMr. Meadows wrote that he “instructed everyone” in Mr. Trump’s immediate circle “to treat him as if he were positive.” If Mr. Trump even thought it possible he might be positive — and he should have — he had a clear obligation to tell those around him/ not to mention the American people who have an interest in his health as chief executive. But Mr. Meadows wrote that after the second test Mr. Trump thought he had “full permission to press on as if nothing had happened.” At least six people who had close interactions with him starting Sept. 26 later tested positive/ including first lady Melania Trump.It is not known exactly when the first test was done/ but on Sept. 26/ Mr. Trump hosted a Rose Garden ceremony for his nominee to the Supreme Court/ Amy Coney Barrett/ including a largely maskless indoor reception. On Sept. 27/ Mr. Trump attended a White House event with Gold Star families/ later noting they often wanted to embrace him/ and suggesting that one of them may have infected him. On Sept. 29/ Mr. Trump faced off against Democratic nominee Joe Biden in a debate at the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland Clinic/ which had relied on a honor system that both candidates and their teams had tested negative. Mr. Trump appears to have abused their trust/ and potentially endangered Mr. Biden/ moderator Chris Wallace and others. Mr. Trump announced that he had tested positive on Twitter at 1 a.m. on Oct. 2 and was hospitalized later that day.When recovering from covid/ Mr. Trump reportedly said he wanted to emerge from the hospital wearing a Superman T-shirt.

Opinion: Joe Biden: How the White House coronavirus response presents us with a false choice,Joe Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee for president of the United States.The coronavirus/ to date/ has taken the lives of more than 79/000 Americans. One of every 5 U.S. workers has filed for unemployment — with the unemployment rate now the highest since the Great Depression. It is an extraordinary moment — the kind that begs for urgent/ steady/ empathetic/ unifying leadership.Opinions to start the day/ in your inbox. Sign up.ArrowRightBut instead of unifying the country to accelerate our public health response and get economic relief to those who need it/ President Trump is reverting to a familiar strategy of deflecting blame and dividing Americans. His goal is as obvious as it is craven: He hopes to split the country into dueling camps/ casting Democrats as doomsayers hoping to keep America grounded and Republicans as freedom fighters trying to liberate the economy.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIt’s a childish tactic — and a false choice that none of us should fall for.Full coverage of the coronavirus pandemicThe truth is that everyone wants America to reopen as soon as possible — claiming otherwise is completely absurd. Governors from both parties are doing their best to make that happen/ but their efforts have been slowed and hampered because they haven’t gotten the tools/ resources and guidance they need from the federal government to reopen safely and sustainably. That responsibility falls on Trump’s shoulders — but he isn’t up to the task.It’s been more than two months since Trump claimed that “anybody that wants a test can get a test.” It was a baldfaced lie when he said it/ and it still isn’t remotely true. If we’re going to have thriving workplaces/ restaurants/ stores and parks/ we need widespread testing. Trump can’t seem to provide it — to say nothing of worker safety protocols/ consistent health guidelines or clear federal leadership to coordinate a responsible reopening.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn addition to forgetting the tests/ he seems to have forgotten that ours is a demand-driven economy — you can shout from the rooftops that we’re open for business/ but the economy will not get back to full strength if the number of new cases is still rising or plateauing and people don’t believe that it’s safe to return to normal activities. Without measures in place to prevent the spread of the virus/ many Americans won’t want to shop in stores/ eat in restaurants or travel; small-business owners know that a nervous public won’t provide enough customers to ensure they thrive.Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) began “reopening” his state’s dine-in restaurants on April 27 — 12 days later/ according to data from restaurant-booking service OpenTable/ there were still 92 percent fewer diners than there were on the same day a year ago. States and cities that have attempted to reopen are discovering that the economy isn’t a light switch you can simply flip on — people need confidence to make it run/ and that confidence must be earned by credible leadership and demonstrable safety.Again/ the solution isn’t a mystery. The Trump administration could focus on producing and distributing adequate testing and protocols that conform with the guidance of public health experts; doing so would speed up the reopening process considerably and make it a whole lot more effective. The administration is fully aware that this is the right path/ too — after all/ the president and his staff are now reportedly receiving daily tests. They knew exactly how to make the Oval Office safe and operational/ and they put in the work to do it.The Opinions section is looking for stories of how the coronavirus has affected people of all walks of life.

Everybody knows that we can’t revive the latter unless we safeguard the former — and pretending otherwise is the most transparent of political ploys. Instead of once again seeking to divide us/ Trump should be working to get Americans the same necessary protections he has gotten for himself.It’s the right thing to do/ and the only path to truly getting the economy back on track.Story continues below advertisementRead more:Read a letter in response to this op-edAdvertisementGovind Persad and Ezekiel J.

Opinion: The puzzle of Joe Biden’s unpopularity,I find President Biden’s unpopularity puzzling. He is rounding out his first year in the White House with the lowest end of first-year approval ratings of any elected president in modern times with the exception of Donald Trump. Why? Biden is a genial/ likable person. Many of the policies he has pursued have been popular/ some even with Republican support. The country is doing reasonably well economically/ as measures such as declining unemployment/ the stock market and interest rates demonstrate. So why did the latest CNN average of the polls have him at 45 percent?Opinions to start the day/ in your inbox. Sign up.ArrowRightOne has to remember that Biden is something of an accidental president. He got elected for two reasons/ neither of which had anything to do with his personal popularity. First/ Barack Obama chose him as vice president/ which instantly elevated him in the Democratic field. Second/ Donald Trump. Had these two factors not been present/ it’s difficult to imagine Biden in the White House.To put this another way/ the previous two times Biden ran for president/ he did not do well. His first attempt/ in 1987/ ended after 3½ months with an abrupt withdrawal — but even before that he was polling well behind in the Democratic field. In his second run/ he stayed in longer/ but his poll numbers were abysmal. A poll released about a month before he dropped out in January 2008/had him at about 4 percent/ and his showing in the Iowa caucuses was under 1 percent.Dana Milbank: The media treats Biden as badly as — or worse than — TrumpSuccessful Democratic presidents usually fit one of two patterns. Either they are charismatic outsiders who energize the country/ like John F.

Perhaps for that reason/ he has struggled to inspire or unite the party and country. To be fair/ it’s much harder for any president to do that in today’s polarized environment. No Democrat and no Republican can expect to get more than about half the country’s approval — a different world from one/ not so long ago/ in which Obama and George H.W. Bush gained sky-high numbers.Henry Olsen: Biden’s polling numbers are even worse than they appearPerhaps Biden’s 11-point drop/ from roughly 56 percent after his first 100 days in office to 45 percent today/ is a natural result of this inherent lack of political capital. But it does seem that other factors have weighed in. The timing of his biggest slide in popularity — this summer — coincided with the withdrawal from Afghanistan/ the rise of the delta variant and the onset of inflation. It’s difficult to parse which was most important/ but they seem to collectively have had the effect of telling Americans that life was not back to normal.In a recent New York Times article/ Nate Cohn explains the flaws behind the assumption that if Biden’s policies are popular/ so should be the president. Such thinking is predicated on the existence of an electorate that is carefully studying the various proposals out there/ weighing the evidence about each one/ choosing carefully and then supporting the politician who backs their favorite bills. That may be how some people make political judgments — specifically/ those who watch cable news/ follow opinion columns/ vote in primaries and are active on Twitter.Paul Waldman: How Democrats misunderstand Biden’s bully pulpitBut they represent a small minority of voters. As Cohn notes/ “Voters seem to reward presidents for presiding over peace and prosperity—in a word/ normalcy.”  To the extent that things do seem to be going well/ voters tend to look favorably on the president. To the extent that they don’t/ they tend to be disillusioned with the White House.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe best summary of the current situation would be “it’s complicated.” The world is largely at peace/ but Americans can see that the country is no longer the sole superpower. The Afghanistan withdrawal was an ugly reminder of that fact. Growth is coming back fast/ but restarting the global economy after a long period of induced paralysis has caused huge logjams and hiccups. For a variety of reasons — some of which can be blamed on Biden — we are seeing more inflation than in decades/ and that has often weighed on presidential approval ratings. Violent crime was up nationwide in 2020. And the pandemic has not ended with a bang but rather continues to wax and wane/ causing new anxieties just when you thought it was safe to get back to normal life.Presidents often get rewarded for being around in good times/ whether they caused them or not. In Joe Biden’s case/ he has mostly handled his job with intelligence and decency. But he is paying the price for the complicated times that we are living through.,13.900000000000002
Opinion: Who’s to blame for Build Back Better’s demise? Joe Biden.,Democrats have predictably condemned Sen.

Sign up.ArrowRightBut this is more like blaming the messenger than identifying the real reason BBB has been shelved. That reason is Biden himself.Biden/ by all accounts/ is a likable and accommodating fellow. He built genuine friendships on both sides of the aisle during his 36 years in the Senate. He prides himself on his ability to use his personality and willingness to compromise to good effect behind closed doors. For Biden/ this is leadership.Story continues below advertisementGenuine leadership/ however/ is something altogether different. Successful political leaders make clear statements of direction/ provide specific proposals to move in that direction and compel people to join them through artful rhetoric and hard-knuckled politics. That often requires negotiations around the edges/ as was the case when President Ronald Reagan tweaked his tax-cut package to secure its passage. It does not/ however/ entail evisceration of the original package/ nor does it take place solely in backroom conversations.AdvertisementBiden’s entire approach to passing his signature package was thus flawed. He made a huge $3.5 trillion initial proposal and then effectively left the baby to die in Congress. Rather than using his bully pulpit to set the national agenda/ Biden retreated to his comfort zone/ relying primarily on his Senate persona as the wheeler-dealer extraordinaire to gather support. He gave some speeches on the package/ but he also allowed other issues to distract from his agenda/ including his poorly timed retreat from Afghanistan during the summer/ a period when a wise leader would have focused national attention on his top legislative priority.Follow Henry Olsen‘s opinionsFollowAddGreg SargentcounterpointWest Virginia’s coal miners just made Joe Manchin’s life a lot harderThis approach was floundering well before Manchin’s announcement. House moderates objected to various provisions while others/ including Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.)/ slowly whittled the package down. By the autumn/ key elements such as the proposal to raise corporate tax rates were gone/ and an entirely new provision — raising the limit on how much state and local taxes the wealthy can deduct from their federal income taxes — was inserted. In time/ the package became a grab bag of elements that different Democratic factions insisted were needed to secure their support.Story continues below advertisementBiden’s leadership skills were AWOL during this embarrassing display. He initially said he would not sign the bipartisan infrastructure bill if he didn’t also get Build Back Better. Indeed/ he farcically appeared before House Democrats in early October to urge them not to back House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) effort to bring the infrastructure bill to a separate vote/ something many said was “whipping against his own bill.” By late October/ Biden had flipped and signaled that he would sign the infrastructure bill without an ironclad guarantee Build Back Better would pass the Senate. He surely thought he was getting what he could/ but he was also sending the clear signal that he would follow Congress/ not the other way around.AdvertisementBiden could have acted differently from the outset. He could have made support for his initial proposal a measure of party loyalty/ much as Reagan did with his controversial tax and spending-cut plans in 1981. Reagan’s Republican Party was far from uniformly conservative/ with many holding voting records that were objectively on the left. These members all swallowed their unease with the new president’s agenda and gave it their backing. If Biden genuinely wanted a big/ transformational bill/ this was his only serious way forward. But that would have required the type of public focus and private pressure Biden doesn’t like.He alternatively could have gone small and sided with the party’s moderates. Instead of pressuring moderates to go big/ he could have confronted progressives and pushed them to abandon most of their wish list. This would have been risky/ as progressives increasingly represent the party’s activist/ donor and staffing elements. But it might have been more successful in securing a deal.Story continues below advertisementNow/ Biden has the worst of both worlds. He has no bill and looks weak. The only way forward is to belatedly pick a side and use the pulpit plus pressure tactics he should have employed when he was in a strong position. Whatever he does is unlikely to succeed/ and he will make further enemies within the party either way he goes.Michael Dukakis/ the Massachusetts governor and Democratic presidential nominee in 1988/ once attacked Reagan’s administration by saying “a fish rots from the head first.” Democrats are belatedly realizing that’s absolutely right.,11.200000000000001
Joe Biden: Americans decided health care is for all. The GOP wants to roll that back.,As vice president/ I met with Americans all across our country. What they told me over and over is that the Affordable Care Act gave them peace of mind — that if they got sick/ or if their child got sick/ they could get care and not have to worry about going broke as a result. They no longer had to lay awake at night wondering: Can I pay for this treatment? What happens if she gets cancer? How will I feed my family and afford the care?Opinions to start the day/ in your inbox.

And if they take that peace of mind away/ they’ll have to look Americans in the eye and explain to them that they have to start worrying again.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementLast week/ Vice President Pence told the National Governors Association that the GOP health-care bill currently being debated in the Senate “strengthens and secures Medicaid for the neediest in our society.” Respectfully/ that’s simply not the case. Their bill tries to deal with opioid addiction on the cheap/ eviscerates the ACA’s Medicaid expansion and guts the ACA’s promise that care like maternity and mental health and substance-use disorder services must be part of any viable health coverage system. They want to drag us back to a time — not all that long ago — when Americans could be denied basic health care because they were unable to afford it. That’s the reality of where we are today and it’s enough to make your blood boil.Now/ I hear some folks say: But hospitals don’t turn anyone away from the emergency room. Before the Affordable Care Act/ though/ hospitals provided about $40 billion each year in uncompensated care. People who didn’t have health insurance or couldn’t cover their co-pays were putting off needed medical care and skipping out on preventive care altogether. That’s not a sustainable model/ and we’re better than that. A health-care system built around emergency room visits isn’t a health-care system at all.[Here’s why Trump is already waffling on Obamacare]AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe ACA isn’t perfect/ but the choices we made when designing the law flowed from a commitment to provide the best possible care to the most people. Compare that to Republican proposals/ which the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said will mean more than 20 million fewer people will have health coverage by 2026/ and millions more will no longer have the same protections provided by the ACA.Here are just some of the people who could lose access to care if congressional Republicans get their way:More than 70 million Americans rely on Medicaid/ including close to 2 million veterans. Medicaid/ including the Children’s Health Insurance Program/ covers 39 percent of children in America/ 49 percent of all births/ 35 percent of Americans with disabilities and 64 percent of nursing home residents/ around seven in ten of whom are women. Rural hospitals would be hit especially hard by proposed cuts because they’ve benefitted most from the Medicaid expansion that has meant fewer uninsured requiring uncompensated care/ and yet Senate Republican leadership is looking to cut Medicaid by about three-quarters of a trillion dollars.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSlashing the Medicaid expansion would affect over a million Americans who’ve used it to cover mental health and substance-use disorder treatment. The original Senate bill proposed spending $2 billion to address the opioid epidemic — a drop in the bucket when it comes to addressing a crisis that is ravaging communities and ripping the heart out of our country.After facing an outcry/ Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell increased that to $45 billion. But my longtime Senate colleague is/ I believe/ missing the point. You can’t take away comprehensive health insurance from people struggling with opioid addiction and then just throw $2 billion or/ for that matter/ $45 billion their way for treatment. Experts say we need closer to $183 billion over 10 years to provide those on Medicaid with treatment for addiction and to provide care for other illnesses that often affect those addicted to opioids. Americans in communities affected by this epidemic understand firsthand that the status quo is grossly inadequate. We must do more to address this crisis/ not less.A middle-class family getting health insurance through a small employer could lose coverage for maternity care/ mental health care or substance-use disorder services.

(Meg Kelly/The Washington Post)The new bill would create two individual insurance markets: One in which insurers must cover people with preexisting conditions/ and one in which they don’t. And you don’t need a Ph.D. in economics to guess what would happen next: Healthier/ younger people would flock to the less expensive/ unregulated market.

Helping Tunisia realize its democratic promise,Tunisians voters line up at a polling station in Menzeh/ near Tunis/ in 2011. (Amine Landoulsi/Associated Press)       By  Barack Obama and    Béji Caïd Essebsi     May 20/ 2015     Barack Obama and Béji Caïd Essebsi are/ respectively/ the presidents of the United States and Tunisia.   Amid the turmoil that so often dominates the headlines/ it can be tempting to think that all of North Africa and the Middle East is gripped by disorder. But in Tunisia/ where the Arab Spring began/ democracy and pluralism are taking root. Our meeting at the White House Thursday — the first between a U.S. president and a democratically elected Tunisian president — will be an opportunity to mark Tunisia’s progress and deepen the partnership between our nations to help Tunisia’s new democracy deliver the greater prosperity and security that its citizens deserve. More than four years after a young street vendor/ Mohammed Bouazizi/ set himself on fire to protest the daily humiliations of an oppressive government/ sparking the protests that ended decades of dictatorship/ Tunisia shows that democracy is not only possible but also necessary in North Africa and the Middle East. Since the revolution/ Tunisians have repeatedly cast their ballots in free and fair elections/ choosing from more than 100 political parties. After a vibrant debate/ and in an impressive display of compromise and consensus/ a new constitution was crafted/ rooted in the rule of law/ upholding freedom of religion and guaranteeing human rights and equality for all people/ including women and minorities. Today’s national unity government includes secularists and Islamists/ proving that democracy and Islam can thrive together.  Tunisia’s democratic journey has not been easy. During the transition/ brave political leaders were gunned down. The old regime’s legacy of mismanagement and corruption continues to stifle economic growth. The terrorist attack on the National Bardo Museum in March killed Tunisians and foreign tourists alike. Tunisia/ a country of 11 million people/ has absorbed waves of people fleeing the fighting in neighboring Libya. Despite these extraordinary challenges/ Tunisians have remained united and determined to protect their young democracy. Our two nations now have an unprecedented opportunity to forge an enduring partnership based on shared interests and values. Indeed/ since the revolution/ the United States has committed more than $570 million/ and supported two major loan guarantees/ to help Tunisians pursue critical political/ economic and security reforms. Over the past year alone/ the United States has worked to double its assistance to Tunisia/ with $134 million proposed for next year. This is not charity; it’s a smart investment in our shared future/ and our meetings Thursday will focus on three priorities. First/ we can do more together to help Tunisians consolidate their democratic gains. The United States is committed to helping Tunisians build transparent/ effective and accountable institutions that truly serve the people. Together/ we can empower civil society and a free press/ which strengthen democracy. Even as we confront security threats such as terrorism/ we must uphold the universal values of tolerance/ inclusivity and freedom of speech that terrorists seek to destroy. Second/ we can partner to ensure that Tunisia’s political revolution is followed by an economic revolution that reduces poverty and delivers tangible improvements to the daily lives of the Tunisian people. Tunisia has embarked on important reforms to reduce bureaucracy/ attract more investment and encourage the growth that creates jobs. The United States will continue to provide technical and economic assistance to help these reforms succeed. We’re especially focused on reducing high unemployment among Tunisian youth. Our entrepreneurship and job-training programs aim to help more young Tunisians develop the skills to start their own businesses and create jobs in their communities. New partnerships between our universities are focused on encouraging innovation and business development. Our educational exchanges are helping promising Tunisian students pursue degrees in science/ technology/ engineering and math/ all of which will be critical to growing the Tunisian economy. Finally/ we aim to deepen the security cooperation that protects our citizens. Working together/ we have helped the Tunisian armed forces build their capacity to undertake counterterrorism missions. The United States is working to more than double its military financing assistance to Tunisia next year to help its forces stay ahead of evolving threats. As we strengthen our counterterrorism partnership/ we can do even more together to confront common threats such as the terrorist group known as ISIL or Daesh and instability in Libya.  Casting her ballot in the second round of the presidential election in December/ one Tunisian voter said/ “This is a big day.” And she added/ “Freedom and democracy are the biggest winners.”  After decades of dictatorship and several years of transition/ Tunisians have won their freedom and democracy. There are still many big days ahead as Tunisians strive to deliver the dignity/ opportunity and prosperity sought by a young vendor more than four years ago. It won’t be easy. But as Tunisians seek to build the Arab world’s newest democracy/ they will continue to have a strong friend and partner in the world’s oldest democracy/ the United States of America.

Obama: How we can make our vision of a world without nuclear weapons a reality,A file photograph showing an Iranian security officer walking in front of the nuclear power plant in Bushehr / southern Iran on 21 August 2010. (Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA)       By  Barack Obama     March 30/ 2016     Barack Obama is president of the United States.   Of all the threats to global security and peace/ the most dangerous is the proliferation and potential use of nuclear weapons. That’s why/ seven years ago in Prague/ I committed the United States to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and to seeking a world without them. This vision builds on the policies of presidents before me/ Democrat and Republican/ including Ronald Reagan/ who said “we seek the total elimination one day of nuclear weapons from the face of the Earth.”   Thursday in Washington/ I’ll welcome more than 50 world leaders to our fourth Nuclear Security Summit to advance a central pillar of our Prague Agenda: preventing terrorists from obtaining and using a nuclear weapon. We’ll review our progress/ such as successfully ridding more than a dozen countries of highly enriched uranium and plutonium. Nations/ including the United States/ will make new commitments/ and we’ll continue strengthening the international treaties and institutions that underpin nuclear security.  Given the continued threat posed by organizations such as the terrorist group we call ISIL/ or ISIS/ we’ll also join allies and partners in reviewing our counterterrorism efforts/ to prevent the world’s most dangerous networks from obtaining the world’s most dangerous weapons. Beyond preventing nuclear terrorism/ we’ve made important progress toward the broader vision I outlined in Prague.      President Obama laid out the work that needed to be done to improve nuclear security in advance of the nuclear security summit beginning March 31. Obama was speaking at the closing session of the last summit/ held in 2014. (The White House)   First/ we’re taking concrete steps toward a world without nuclear weapons. The United States and Russia remain on track to meet our New START Treaty obligations so that by 2018 the number of deployed American and Russian nuclear warheads will be at their lowest levels since the 1950s. Even as the United States maintains a safe/ secure and effective nuclear arsenal to deter any adversary and ensure the security of our allies/ I’ve reduced the number and role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy. I also have ruled out developing new nuclear warheads and narrowed the contingencies under which the United States would ever use or threaten to use nuclear weapons.  Second/ we’re strengthening the global regime — including the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty — that prevents the spread of nuclear weapons. We’ve succeeded in uniting the international community against the spread of nuclear weapons/ notably in Iran. A nuclear-armed Iran would have constituted an unacceptable threat to our national security and that of our allies and partners. It could have triggered a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and begun to unravel the global nonproliferation regime.  After Iran initially rejected a diplomatic solution/ the United States mobilized the international community to impose sanctions on Iran/ demonstrating that nations that fail to meet their nuclear obligations will face consequences. After intense negotiations/ Iran agreed to a nuclear deal that closes every single one of its paths to a nuclear weapon/ and Iran is now being subjected to the most comprehensive inspection regimen ever negotiated to monitor a nuclear program. In other words/ under this deal/ the world has prevented yet another nation from getting a nuclear bomb. And we’ll remain vigilant to ensure that Iran fulfills its commitments.  Third/ we’re pursuing a new framework for civil nuclear cooperation so countries that meet their responsibilities can have access to peaceful nuclear energy. The international fuel bank that I called for seven years ago is now being built in Kazakhstan. With it/ countries will be able to realize the energy they seek without enriching uranium/ which could be at risk of diversion or theft. Our progress notwithstanding/ I’m the first to acknowledge that we still have unfinished business. Given its violations of the INF Treaty/ we continue to call on Russia to comply fully with its obligations. Along with our military leadership/ I continue to believe that our massive Cold War nuclear arsenal is poorly suited to today’s threats. The United States and Russia — which together hold more than 90 percent of the world’s nuclear weapons — should negotiate to reduce our stockpiles further. The international community must remain united in the face of North Korea’s continued provocations/ including its recent nuclear test and missile launches. The additional sanctions recently imposed on Pyongyang by the United Nations Security Council show that violations have consequences. The United States will continue working with allies and partners for the complete and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful manner. More broadly/ the security of the world demands that nations — including the United States — ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and conclude a new treaty to end the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons once and for all.  I said in Prague that achieving the security and peace of a world without nuclear weapons will not happen quickly/ perhaps not in my lifetime. But we have begun. As the only nation ever to use nuclear weapons/ the United States has a moral obligation to continue to lead the way in eliminating them. Still/ no one nation can realize this vision alone. It must be the work of the world.  We’re clear-eyed about the high hurdles ahead/ but I believe that we must never resign ourselves to the fatalism that the spread of nuclear weapons is inevitable. Even as we deal with the realities of the world as it is/ we must continue to strive for our vision of the world as it ought to be.

Barack Obama: Why we must rethink solitary confinement,President Barack Obama. (Andrew Burton/Getty Images)       By  Barack Obama     January 25/ 2016     Barack Obama is president of the United States.   In 2010/ a 16-year-old named Kalief Browder from the Bronx was accused of stealing a backpack. He was sent to Rikers Island to await trial/ where he reportedly endured unspeakable violence at the hands of inmates and guards — and spent nearly two years in solitary confinement.  In 2013/ Kalief was released/ having never stood trial. He completed a successful semester at Bronx Community College. But life was a constant struggle to recover from the trauma of being locked up alone for 23 hours a day. One Saturday/ he committed suicide at home. He was just 22 years old.  Solitary confinement gained popularity in the United States in the early 1800s/ and the rationale for its use has varied over time. Today/ it’s increasingly overused on people such as Kalief/ with heartbreaking results — which is why my administration is taking steps to address this problem.  There are as many as 100/000 people held in solitary confinement in U.S. prisons — including juveniles and people with mental illnesses. As many as 25/000 inmates are serving months/ even years of their sentences alone in a tiny cell/ with almost no human contact.      In a speech to members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in July 2015 where he called for criminal justice reform/ President Obama said that solitary confinement "is not going to make us safer." (YouTube/The White House)   Research suggests that solitary confinement has the potential to lead to devastating/ lasting psychological consequences. It has been linked to depression/ alienation/ withdrawal/ a reduced ability to interact with others and the potential for violent behavior. Some studies indicate that it can worsen existing mental illnesses and even trigger new ones. Prisoners in solitary are more likely to commit suicide/ especially juveniles and people with mental illnesses.  The United States is a nation of second chances/ but the experience of solitary confinement too often undercuts that second chance. Those who do make it out often have trouble holding down jobs/ reuniting with family and becoming productive members of society. Imagine having served your time and then being unable to hand change over to a customer or look your wife in the eye or hug your children.  As president/ my most important job is to keep the American people safe. And since I took office/ overall crime rates have decreased by more than 15 percent. In our criminal justice system/ the punishment should fit the crime — and those who have served their time should leave prison ready to become productive members of society. How can we subject prisoners to unnecessary solitary confinement/ knowing its effects/ and then expect them to return to our communities as whole people? It doesn’t make us safer. It’s an affront to our common humanity.  That’s why last summer/ I directed Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch and the Justice Department to review the overuse of solitary confinement across U.S. prisons. They found that there are circumstances when solitary is a necessary tool/ such as when certain prisoners must be isolated for their own protection or in order to protect staff and other inmates. In those cases/ the practice should be limited/ applied with constraints and used only as a measure of last resort. They have identified common-sense principles that should guide the use of solitary confinement in our criminal justice system. The Justice Department has completed its review/ and I am adopting its recommendations to reform the federal prison system. These include banning solitary confinement for juveniles and as a response to low-level infractions/ expanding treatment for the mentally ill and increasing the amount of time inmates in solitary can spend outside of their cells. These steps will affect some 10/000 federal prisoners held in solitary confinement — and hopefully serve as a model for state and local corrections systems. And I will direct all relevant federal agencies to review these principles and report back to me with a plan to address their use of solitary confinement.   [More coverage: Obama bans solitary confinement for juveniles in federal prisons]  States that have led the way are already seeing positive results. Colorado cut the number of people in solitary confinement/ and assaults against staff are the lowest they’ve been since 2006. New Mexico implemented reforms and has seen a drop in solitary confinement/ with more prisoners engaging in promising rehabilitation programs. And since 2012/ federal prisons have cut the use of solitary confinement by 25 percent and significantly reduced assaults on staff.  Reforming solitary confinement is just one part of a broader bipartisan push for criminal justice reform. Every year/ we spend $80 billion to keep 2.2 million people incarcerated. Many criminals belong behind bars. But too many others/ especially nonviolent drug offenders/ are serving unnecessarily long sentences. That’s why members of Congress in both parties are pushing for change/ from reforming sentencing laws to expanding reentry programs to give those who have paid their debt to society the tools they need to become productive members of their communities. And I hope they will send me legislation as soon as possible that makes our criminal justice system smarter/ fairer/ less expensive and more effective. In America/ we believe in redemption. We believe/ in the words of Pope Francis/ that “every human person is endowed with an inalienable dignity/ and society can only benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes.” We believe that when people make mistakes/ they deserve the opportunity to remake their lives. And if we can give them the hope of a better future/ and a way to get back on their feet/ then we will leave our children with a country that is safer/ stronger and worthy of our highest ideals.

Despite a year and a half of U.S. air strikes/ the group retains a large domain and has spawned affiliates across the region.Advertisement[The shadowy JSOC general expected to be the next leader of America’s special operations forces]Scrutiny of Centcom’s management of the war has increased following a series of disappointments over the last year/ including the fall of the Iraqi city of Ramadi in May and the failure of a high-profile plan to stand up a new moderate rebel force in Syria.Story continues below advertisementMilitary officials are also investigating allegations that intelligence analysts at Centcom provided overly upbeat depictions of the Islamic State conflict.It’s widely expected that Army Lt. Gen. Raymond “Tony” Thomas III will take over for Votel at U.S. Special Operations Command/ though it wasn’t clear whether his name had been formally submitted to the White House. Thomas now leads JSOC and has extensive experience in Washington/ where he served on both the Joint Staff and as Assistant Director for Military Affairs at the CIA.AdvertisementIn 2007 and 2008/ Thomas was a deputy commander in northern Iraq/ a tour that gave him a deep knowledge of Mosul/ a city that is currently under the control of the Islamic State and will likely be a major focus of Iraqi military operations in the coming year.Story continues below advertisementHe spent even more time in Afghanistan/ most recently as the head of special operations command based in Kabul. Thomas/ like Votel/ spent much of his career in the Army with the Rangers and its counter-terror forces.The elevation of Votel to lead Central Command leaves Gen. John Campbell as the odd man out for the moment. Campbell/ the top commander in Afghanistan/ was a critical voice last fall in convincing Obama to abandon his pledge to withdraw American forces from the country by the end of his presidency.Despite the Afghan army’s recent struggles against the Taliban and a deadly U.S. air attack on a civilian medical facility in October/ Campbell has been praised as a steady leader by both senior Afghan officials and the White House. It’s unclear if Campbell/ who is due to leave Afghanistan in the coming months/ will be offered another four-star position or choose to retire.,10.4
Obama makes surprise visit to D.C. vaccination site amid polarized virus debate,Students at Kimball Elementary School in Southeast D.C. expected to receive stickers/ maybe a T-shirt/ after getting a coronavirus  shot on Tuesday afternoon. But shortly after workers began the vaccinations/ a tall/ gangly former president ambled into the school’s multipurpose room.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRight“We are just getting through the holiday season and we have one more thing to be thankful for/ which is that we can get kids vaccinated if they’re between the ages of 5 and 11/” Barack Obama told the crowd of more than 50 students/ teachers and parents. “Nobody really loves getting a shot. I don’t love getting a shot. But I do it because it’s going to help keep me healthy.”Obama was accompanied by Anthony S. Fauci/ the government’s top infectious-diseases expert/ in the surprise event at a vaccination clinic.Story continues below advertisementThe visit infused some star power into the polarized vaccination debate at a tenuous time for the Biden administration’s fight against the coronavirus pandemic.AdvertisementAs large pockets of resistance to getting vaccinated endure/ the recently discovered omicron variant threatens to make the pandemic longer and more complicated.Pivotal questions remain about whether current defenses against the coronavirus will suffice or if leaders will call for more restrictive mitigation measures — meaning a second straight holiday season of Zoom Christmas parties and socially distant season’s greetings.Those fears have already sent shock waves through financial markets and may have political consequences/ particularly for President Biden/ who made a competent coronavirus response a central tenet of his campaign for the White House.Story continues below advertisementOn Monday/ the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expanded its recommendations for booster shots/ saying every American 18 and older should get them. In a speech from the White House the same day/ Biden tried to quell fears/ saying the omicron variant was “a cause for concern” but “not a cause for panic.”AdvertisementBut scientists and public health leaders have conceded there is still much they do not know about the latest variant/ and what effect it will have on the ongoing pandemic. Cases have been confirmed in 20 countries so far/ though not in the United States.Scientists say the variant’s high number of mutations might make it both highly transmissible and more capable of getting past immune defenses/ including among those who have been vaccinated.Story continues below advertisementOn Tuesday/ the CEO of Moderna/ the maker of one of the most prevalent and popular vaccines/ said that existing vaccines might be less effective at combating the omicron variant than other variants.Biden stressed Monday that coronavirus vaccinations remain the best defense against the virus/ but millions of Americans still fear the vaccine more than the virus it’s meant to protect against.AdvertisementAt the gym with lowered basketball rims on Tuesday/ Obama and Fauci tried to allay some of those fears in simple terms.The vaccinations/ Fauci said/ “are really going to protect you. We know that from a lot of data/ and a lot of experience we have.”Later/ Obama stressed that vaccinations were about more than simply not getting sick/ but imperative for any return to normalcy/ including in school.Story continues below advertisement“It’s also going to help keep schools open because the more kids are vaccinated/ the less likely that we’re going to have a covid outbreak in the schools. And that means our kids have a chance to learn together and socialize — you know/ do all the things that you’re supposed to be doing when you’re 5 or 6 or 7 or 11.”He told anyone with enduring doubts to consult trusted messengers as they sought to chart the safest course through the pandemic.Advertisement“I think it’s really important for everyone to be informed and to talk to an informed health-care professional/” Obama said. “Talk to your family doctor. Talk to your pediatrician and get the information you need to make an informed decision.”Story continues below advertisementStill/ he was proselytizing the converted. Most of the people had come to the school of their own accord to get a first or second shot for their children/ and the former president's arrival was mostly a closely guarded secret until he walked onto the hardwood floor.Later/ some students said they realized it was more than a run-of-the-mill after-school event: Teachers milled around the halls after the closing bell/ Secret Service agents inspected the crowd/ and reporters stood at the ready before Obama made his entrance.“I thought Joe Biden was going to walk through the door/” one student told reporters.,11.799999999999999
Opinion: George W. Bush: Immigration is a defining asset of the United States. Here’s how to restore confidence in our system.,George W. Bush was the 43rd president of the United States.Next week/ I’m proud to publish a new collection of my paintings/ entitled “Out of Many/ One.” The book may not set the art world stirring — hopefully/ the critics won’t call it “One Too Many.”I set out to accomplish two things: to share some portraits of immigrants/ each with a remarkable story I try to tell/ and to humanize the debate on immigration and reform.I hope that these faces/ and the stories that accompany them/ serve as a reminder that immigration isn’t just a part of our heritage. New Americans are just as much a force for good now/ with their energy/ idealism and love of country/ as they have always been.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementI write about a champion runner who barely survived ethnic violence in East Africa/ and who told me/ “America has given me everything I dreamed of as a boy.” I share the story of a young man from France who followed his dream to become an American soldier/ and went on to earn the Medal of Honor. And readers may recognize two distinguished citizens who fled prewar Europe as children/ and who each became U.S. secretary of state.The backgrounds are varied/ but readers won’t have to search hard for a common theme. It’s gratitude. So many immigrants are filled with appreciation/ a spirit nicely summed up by a Cuban American friend who said: “If I live for a hundred years/ I could never repay what this country has done for me.”The help and respect historically accorded to new arrivals is one reason so many people still aspire and wait to become Americans. So how is it that in a country more generous to new arrivals than any other/ immigration policy is the source of so much rancor and ill will? The short answer is that the issue has been exploited in ways that do little credit to either party. And no proposal on immigration will have credibility without confidence that our laws are carried out consistently and in good faith.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Out of Many/ One” is not a brief for any specific set of policies/ which I leave to the political leaders of today. However/ the book — along with the George W. Bush Presidential Center — does set forth principles for reform that can restore the people’s confidence in an immigration system that serves both our values and our interests.One place to start is DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals). Americans who favor a path to citizenship for those brought here as children/ known as "dreamers/" are not advocating open borders. They just recognize that young men and women who grew up in the United States/ and who never knew any other place as home/ are fundamentally American. And they ought not be punished for choices made by their parents.Another opportunity for agreement is the border. I have long said that we can be both a lawful and a welcoming nation at the same time. We need a secure and efficient border/ and we should apply all the necessary resources — manpower/ physical barriers/ advanced technology/ streamlined and efficient ports of entry/ and a robust legal immigration system — to assure it.Effective border management starts well beyond the border/ so we must work with our neighbors to help them build freedom and opportunity so their citizens can thrive at home. We cannot rely on enforcement alone to prevent the untenable and so often heartbreaking scenes that come with large-scale migration.We also need a modernized asylum system that provides humanitarian support and appropriate legal channels for refugees to pursue their cases in a timely manner. The rules for asylum should be reformed by Congress to guard against unmerited entry and reserve that vital status for its intended recipients.Increased legal immigration/ focused on employment and skills/ is also a choice that both parties should be able to get behind. The United States is better off when talented people bring their ideas and aspirations here. We could also improve our temporary entry program/ so that seasonal and other short-term jobs can more readily be filled by guest workers who help our economy/ support their families and then return home.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAs for the millions of undocumented men and women currently living in the United States/ a grant of amnesty would be fundamentally unfair to those who came legally or are still waiting their turn to become citizens. But undocumented immigrants should be brought out of the shadows through a gradual process in which legal residency and citizenship must be earned/ as for anyone else applying for the privilege. Requirements should include proof of work history/ payment of a fine and back taxes/ English proficiency and knowledge of U.S. history and civics/ and a clean background check. We should never forget that the desire to live in the United States — a worldwide and as powerful an aspiration as ever — is an affirmation of our country and what we stand for. Over the years/ our instincts have always tended toward fairness and generosity. The reward has been generations of grateful/ hard-working/ self-reliant/ patriotic Americans who came here by choice.If we trust those instincts in the current debate/ then bipartisan reform is possible. And we will again see immigration for what it is: not a problem and source of discord/ but a great and defining asset of the United States.Read more:Fareed Zakaria: Biden’s generous immigration policies could turn out to backfireEugene Robinson: Biden’s immigration plan is ambitious.

George W. Bush: PEPFAR saves millions of lives in Africa. Keep it fully funded.,Former president George W. Bush greets children at a school in Gaborone/ Botswana. (Mike Hutchings/Reuters)       Opinion by  George W. Bush     April 7/ 2017     George W. Bush served as 43rd president of the United States and founded the George W. Bush Institute in Dallas.   Last week in Gaborone/ Botswana/ Laura and I sat in a small room in Tlokweng Main Clinic/ a facility that recently started screening and treating women for cervical cancer. Seated with us was Leithailwe Wale/ a 40-year-old woman who was diagnosed with the disease. Thanks to early detection and access to treatment/ she told us/ today she is alive/ healthy and able to raise her son.  Good news like Leithailwe’s is becoming increasingly common in five African countries where Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon is operating. Since leaving the White House/ Laura and I have been heartbroken to learn that because women with HIV are more likely to have cervical cancer/ people who had been saved from AIDS were needlessly dying from another treatable/ preventable disease. So at the Bush Institute/ we formed this global public-private partnership to fight women’s cancers. In the past six years/ more than 370/000 women have been screened for cervical cancer and 24/000 for breast cancer through Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon. More than 119/000 girls have been vaccinated against the human papillomavirus (HPV)/ which can lead to cervical and other cancers. Nearly 1/000 health workers have been trained. With the proper resources and international commitment/ we could end cervical cancer deaths on the continent in 30 years.  Critical to this effort is our Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon partner/ the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). My administration launched PEPFAR in 2003 to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic that threatened to wipe out an entire generation on the continent of Africa. Nearly 15 years later/ the program has achieved remarkable results in the fight against disease. Today/ because of the commitment of many foreign governments/ investments by partners/ the resilience of the African people and the generosity of the American people/ nearly 12 million lives have been saved. And nearly 2 million babies have been born HIV-free to infected mothers.  In Windhoek/ Namibia — where we introduced a partnership with the government/ UNAIDS/ the Global Fund and Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon — Laura/ the first lady of Namibia and I met some of those newborns and their moms. Almost all the mothers had AIDS/ but the babies were disease-free. It was so heartwarming to see those hopeful young lives and their proud/ relieved mothers — and it was a powerful reminder that we need to not only keep this effort alive/ but also do more. It is clear that the generosity of the American people has had a huge impact — one that reflects the view that all lives are precious/ and to whom much is given/ much is required. This lifesaving work also has a practical purpose for Americans. Societies mired in disease breed hopelessness and despair/ leaving people ripe for recruitment by extremists. When we confront suffering — when we save lives — we breathe hope into devastated populations/ strengthen and stabilize society/ and make our country and the world safer.  As the executive and legislative branches review the federal budget/ they will have vigorous debates about how best to spend taxpayers’ money — and they should. Some will argue that we have enough problems at home and shouldn’t spend money overseas. I argue that we shouldn’t spend money on programs that don’t work/ whether at home or abroad. But they should fully fund programs that have proven to be efficient/ effective and results-oriented. Saving nearly 12 million lives is proof that PEPFAR works/ and I urge our government to fully fund it. We are on the verge of an AIDS-free generation/ but the people of Africa still need our help. The American people deserve credit for this tremendous success and should keep going until the job is done.

George W. Bush to hold fundraiser with Rep. Liz Cheney next month,Former president George W. Bush is holding a fundraiser next month with Rep. Liz Cheney/ as the Wyoming Republican and prominent critic of former president Donald Trump faces a tough reelection battle.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThe event marks a rare campaign-trail appearance by Bush. Cheney is the daughter of Richard B. Cheney/ Bush’s former vice president.Trump has vowed to unseat Cheney since she voted to impeach him in January over his role in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol/ which was carried out by a mob of supporters who echoed his false claims about the election while seeking to stop Congress from certifying its results and declaring Joe Biden the president-elect.Story continues below advertisementEarlier this month/ Trump endorsed Cheney’s primary opponent/ Harriet Hageman. The contest will serve as the marquee test of the former president’s ability to purge his critics from the party.AdvertisementNews of the fundraiser was first reported by Politico. A person familiar with the matter confirmed the event to The Washington Post.According to an invitation for the fundraiser/ several other top Republicans in Bush’s orbit are expected to attend the Oct. 18 event in Dallas. They include former Bush political adviser Karl Rove/ former Bush senior adviser Karen Hughes/ former White House counsel Harriet Miers/ and former senator and U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison.,5.3
George W. Bush and the worst predictions about the Afghanistan war,After 20 long years/ the U.S. war in Afghanistan is officially over/ with the full withdrawal of troops having taken place ahead of the Tuesday deadline.And while the focus is presently on how the Biden administration prosecuted the chaotic withdrawal after offering false assurances about it/ those false assurances are merely the latest in the long series that has marked America’s longest war.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThe Washington Post’s Craig Whitlock has documented much of this extensively in his new book/ which includes comparing the public comments from the administrations to what they were saying privately.With the war now over/ it’s worth taking stock of just how it was sold to the American people — and just how much the outcome belies that sales job.Story continues below advertisementThe big upshot of the present situation is that the Taliban/ which the United States went to war to uproot/ is back in charge in the country immediately upon the withdrawal.AdvertisementAnd that’s something we had been promised over and over again wouldn’t happen. In fact/ early in the war/ the Bush administration spoke of the Taliban as if it had been utterly obliterated. It repeatedly used the word “eliminated.”“With the Taliban eliminated and al-Qaeda badly damaged/” then-White House national security adviser Condoleezza Rice said in April 2002/ “we have moved into the second stage of our war on terror.”President George W. Bush in November 2003 used similar language/ saying/ “Our military went to Afghanistan/ destroyed the training camps of al-Qaeda/ and put the Taliban out of business forever.”Story continues below advertisementIn September 2004/ Bush declared that “as a result of the United States military/ the Taliban no longer is in existence.”Even at the time/ this flew in the face of the evidence/ given that Americans were still being attacked and killed. By 2008/ with that still being the case/ Bush claimed: “I never said the Taliban was eliminated; I said they were removed from power.” But the administration had indeed said that — and repeatedly. Bush had literally said the words “out of business forever.”AdvertisementEven as recently as 2012/ former British prime minister Tony Blair was asked how likely it was that the Taliban would return to power upon a full withdrawal. “I don’t believe they will come back in power/” he said.Story continues below advertisementThere’s a fine line when you write these things between a commander in chief expressing confidence in the mission/ and that same president overpromising. But these are hardly the only times Bush ventured into the latter territory — often dismissing precisely the outcome that has now been realized.In April 2002/ Bush declared: “The history of military conflict in Afghanistan [has] been one of initial success/ followed by long years of floundering and ultimate failure. We’re not going to repeat that mistake.”More than six years later/ in his final year in office in 2008/ he added that a troop surge “has an unmistakable message: The Taliban has gone from power/ and it’s not coming back. … Afghanistan will be a successful society and a hopeful society and a free society. And Afghanistan will never again be a safe haven for terrorists to attack the United States of America.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThen-Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld was arguably the most combative about this kind of thing/ repeatedly rebuking those who had dared to suggest the war might not go well.“All together now — quagmire!” Rumsfeld joked at a November 2001 news conference.By 2005/ while playing up the success of the operation/ Rumsfeld gloated as if the naysayers had been proved utterly wrong and a quagmire was off the table.“The Afghan people’s courage should be a stunning reminder to all of those seemingly self-confident prognosticators who foresaw an Afghan quagmire/” Rumsfeld said. “They were not just wrong; they were harmful by making the cause seem hopeless.”Story continues below advertisementRumsfeld went on/ citing three specific newspapers and claiming the critics amounted to the “Cassandras of the West echoing the predictions of the terrorists.”Advertisement“What has taken place in the last four years in Afghanistan is a historic achievement/” he said/ adding: “And history will look back on it as having been an amazing accomplishment.”Bush also predicted what the end of the war would look like as early as 2001/ saying: “This struggle will not end in a truce or a treaty. It will end in victory for the United States/ our friends and for the cause of freedom.”The war in fact ended with the next Republican president cutting a deal with the Taliban/ which that president’s Democratic successor then cited as the reason for the withdrawal.Story continues below advertisementThat Democratic successor/ President Biden/ and his administration have their own recent paper trail of false promises/ including that the Taliban wouldn’t return to power so quickly and that there would be no scenes like those in Vietnam/ where a chaotic withdrawal required people to be airlifted from the U.S. Embassy in Saigon. A strikingly similar situation transpired in Kabul.AdvertisementBut it wasn’t the first time Biden dismissed the possibility of such a situation. MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki this week flagged a 2001 interview/ at the very start of the war/ in which Biden played down the need to defend the new Afghan government from rebels:CHRIS MATTHEWS: Don’t you then have to be a constabulary force and have American GIs over there from Alabama and Arkansas defending a government against rebels? Because there are going to be rebels.BIDEN: No/ not if it’s done well -- and if we get lucky. Because if it ends up that way/ that’s not going to …MATTHEWS: That's Vietnam.BIDEN: Exactly. That’s not going to happen.There are some caveats here/ including that Biden specified things needed to be “done well” to avoid such an outcome. But it became quite evident over the years that the new government needed U.S. protection if it were to survive/ and it collapsed as soon as that protection was heading for the exits.Story continues below advertisementThere are many lessons from the Afghanistan war/ and we’re still learning them to this day/ thanks to the work of Whitlock and others. But an undersold one was just how much our elected leaders dismissed the possibility of the outcome we’ve now encountered/ despite 20 years of effort and many lives lost. The Iraq War’s “mission accomplished” and “greeted as liberators” get all the attention/ but there’s plenty of grist for that mill on Afghanistan/ too.,9.4
George W. Bush’s wars are now over. He retreated a while ago.,In early July/ on the very same day the Pentagon announced it had completed 90 percent of the planned withdrawal from Afghanistan/ former president George W. Bush sat for a rare/ nationally televised interview.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRight“Happy birthday/ Dad!” shouted his daughter Jenna Bush Hager/ a co-host of the “Today” show.Later in the interview/ she asked: “Do you feel 75?”“Well/ it just seemed like yesterday I felt like I was 74/” said the ex-president/ from his house in Maine looking very retired in a blue polo shirt and flashing that familiar smirk.“I wanna know/” asked the other host/ Hoda Kotb/ later in the segment/ “if Jenna gives you really cool gifts?”“One year she gave me a poo-poo cushion/” said Bush.Story continues below advertisement“Dad!” the former first daughter sighed. “A poo-poo cushion is not the name of it! A whoopee cushion!”AdvertisementAn enhanced interrogation/ this was not.When Bush left office/ with his two calamitous wars still raging and only a third of Americans approving of his job performance/ it would have been hard to imagine a network treating him like a goofy dad whose most noteworthy intelligence failure might be flubbing the name of a false fart bag. But a lot has happened since 2009. Bush may have started the Iraq War on false pretenses/ but at least he hadn’t inspired an insurrection that turned the U.S. Capitol into a combat zone. At least he had made efforts to distance himself from the racists and xenophobes in his party rather than cultivate their support. At least he hadn’t gone so far as to call his domestic adversaries “evil.”Story continues below advertisement“He looks like the Babe Ruth of presidents when you compare him to Trump/” former Senate majority leader and onetime Bush nemesis Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said in an interview. “Now/ I look back on Bush with a degree of nostalgia/ with some affection/ which I never thought I would do.”Advertisement“I was so aghast at Trump that I unfortunately didn’t have space left to be mad at Bush/” said Jason Kander/ a Democratic politician who served in Afghanistan. “In comparison to Trump/ I am able to look at Bush and say: At least that guy was trying.”“People have a more benign/ almost fond view of him — common to almost all ex-presidents/” the comic-strip artist and frequent Bush critic Garry Trudeau told The Washington Post in an email/ “and I assume he likes it that way.”Story continues below advertisementBehold/ the incredible disappearing Dubya.The former boogeyman of the American left/ once viewed as rash/ incurious and overly trusting of his gut/ has been eclipsed by an even more absurd/ menacing figure.Donald Trump may be the best thing that ever happened to George W. BushMeanwhile/ the American right has kicked him down the same memory hole as his father.When Bush does appear in public/ he presents as harmless and affable: sharing hard candies with Michelle Obama or hanging out at a Cowboys game with Ellen DeGeneres.AdvertisementNow/ the “Today” anchors were questioning the ex-president/ who famously had taken up painting in retirement/ on the accuracy of a portrait he had made of his daughter. “Can you just try to thin out my face a little bit?” Bush Hager asked.Story continues below advertisement“Look/” Bush chuckled. “I can only paint it the way it is/ hon.”Not that Bush seems to mind the recent alterations to his own portrait.There are many who couldn’t forget the ugliest parts of his legacy if they tried: the tortured/ the dead/ the bereaved. More than 7/000 U.S. service members killed in Afghanistan and Iraq/ according to Brown University’s Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs/ along with tens of thousands of civilians. And yet/ as the American military presence in Afghanistan comes to an end just ahead of the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attack that launched it/ it can feel as if Bush’s most successful war is the one over his reputation.“Oh/ man/” Bush told the “Today” hosts when they reached him on his birthday. “How lucky am I?”“How can anyone agree to be part of the rehabilitation of George Bush?”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIt’s been 17 years since Cindy Sheehan lost her son/ Casey/ on an Iraq battlefield/ and she’s angry that others who had survived that Bush war had agreed to be subjects for the ex-president’s 2017 book of portraits of military veterans.“First of all/ I’m not an art critic/” Sheehan said in a recent phone call. “But his paintings are terrible.” It’s not just the quality/ but the complicity. “How could anyone sit for those portraits/” she said/ “let alone people who were sent to war based on his lies?”Sheehan was an antiwar activist — or/ rather/ the Bush presidency had turned her into one. Sheehan spent weeks in 2005 camped outside of Bush’s home in Crawford/ Tex./ demanding a meeting with the president/ often surrounded by camera crews and thousands of other protesters. When Bush left office/ Sheehan said/ many of her friends told her to move on.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementImpossible/ she said.“I don’t think Bush deserves a quiet retirement/” she said. “I don’t think he deserves people like Ellen DeGeneres sitting next to him and giving him legitimacy like he’s just some nice guy. I don’t think he deserves the rehabilitation or softening of his image. I think he belongs in prison.”“Only in America can a war criminal reinvent himself as the new Bob Ross/” said Michael Moore/ the lefty documentarian whose 2004 movie “Fahrenheit 9/11” took a critical look at Bush’s presidency.Michelle Obama isn’t the only liberal embracing George W. Bush these daysIt’s been a tumultuous/ let’s say six years/ where it’s been hard to keep track of the scandals and blunders from the previous week/ let alone those from more than 13 years ago. It’s a lot to ask for people to remember how long Bush stayed on vacation before turning his attention to Hurricane Katrina/ or how his administration started a war with Iraq under the false pretense that it had weapons of mass destruction/ and had memos drafted to allow torture to be used as an intelligence-gathering technique.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“You gotta hand it to us/” Moore told The Post. “We are a forgiving people/ and a forgetful people.”Trudeau used to spend a lot of time thinking about Bush — and skewering him in his long-running newspaper comic/ “Doonesbury.”“My view changed as he did/” Trudeau wrote in an email. “What started as a feckless/ unfocused presidency assumed under a mantle of privilege and legacy suddenly became operationalized by 9/11. Like his father/ Bush didn’t seem to know what presidents actually did in the absence of war.”The caricature of Bush that took shape during his presidency wasn't of a malevolent tyrant/ but of a fratboy in chief. On "Saturday Night Live/" Will Ferrell played him as a snickering man-child. In a sketch depicting the 2000 ballot recount as a daytime soap/ actors playing Al Gore/ Jeb Bush and Tom Brokaw talk gravely about the state of things while Ferrell/ as Bush/ plays with a ball of string.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThis version of Bush was an idiot/ and a useful one at that/ seen to be taken advantage of by the real Machiavellians of his administration (see: Cheney/ Dick). “A big part of the critique at the time is that he was sort of a failson that was a vehicle for these people/” said Josh Marshall/ who chronicled the Bush years on his website/ Talking Points Memo. “That probably makes it easier for the public to be okay with him leaving everything behind and becoming a painter. Whether it’s true or not.”According to those who served with Bush/ it’s not.“The reality was completely different from ‘Saturday Night Live/’ ” said Michael Chertoff/ Bush’s second secretary of homeland security. According to Chertoff — and also to his current business partner/ Michael Hayden/ the former CIA director/ Bush was an active and thoughtful participant in briefings/ knowledgeable about the issues/ and responsible for the big decisions.AdvertisementThis defense for Bush inevitably raises the question: Which is worse? A president who reads the intelligence and misuses it or a president who can’t be bothered to sit through a briefing in the first place?“I’m not sure I have a good answer for that/” said Marshall. “They are just bad in very different ways. You can say that for all of Trump’s terribleness/ he wasn’t able to break as much abroad. But then again/ he was a president who didn’t accept the results of an election/ and I don’t know how much worse you can get than that.”“I think we judge presidents on outcomes/” said Chertoff/ “but more important than any particular policy outcome is the fundamental process question: Do presidents promote our constitutional democracy/ or do they try to undermine it?”Bush’s own popularity has clearly benefited from his time out of office. Irrelevance proved to be a disinfectant. In 2018/ a poll from CNN found that Bush was viewed favorably by about 6 in 10 Americans. It got to the point where another familiar face had to come out from retirement to stage an intervention.“I just wanted to address my fellow Americans tonight/ and remind you guys that I was really bad/” said Ferrell said/ reprising his role as Bush for an SNL guest spot that year. “Like/ historically not-good.”The fact that Bush no longer holds any sway might help explain the surge in his popularity.The tendency of partisans to hate their opponents when they are in power and praise them when they are powerless is so predictable that Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Tex.) says he can’t take the newfound nostalgia for Bush seriously.“We’re talking about the liberal media here/” said Crenshaw/ a former Navy SEAL who fought in Afghanistan. “They always say/ ‘Yeah/ those old Republicans used to be decent.”On the very day Trump took office/ Bush gave the critics who once thought of him as a dangerous liar reason to think of him as a truth-teller; reportedly saying of the inauguration: “This is some weird s---.”“There are lots of Republican leaders who will whisper about how they miss Bush/” said Frank Luntz/ a pollster who recently renounced his affiliation with the GOP. “But those conversations are happening in places like the Hamptons/ Nantucket/ and Martha’s Vineyard.”It is clear that most everywhere else/ this is no longer Bush’s party. Trump wiped the floor with Bush’s brother/ Jeb/ in the 2016 presidential primary by dissing the entire Bush dynasty/ calling the Iraq War a “a big fat mistake” and accusing George W. of failing to keep America safe because he let 9/11 happen on his watch.The GOP has moved further into Trump’s camp since then/ to the chagrin of the Bush clan. This year/ Jeb’s son/ George P. Bush/ attempted to win support from Trump for his race to become the next attorney general of Texas. Instead/ Trump threw his support behind Ken Paxton/ the current AG/ threatening to squash Bush’s candidacy like so many poo-poo cushions.“One of the big questions hanging over politics is/ ‘What is the Republican Party?’ ” said Chertoff. “Does it continue to exist? Is it totally taken over by Trump? Clearly the loudest voices in the Republican Party are not in the tradition of the Bushes.”Bush seems content to remain one of the quieter voices.“We don’t participate in profiles/legacy pieces/” his spokesman Freddy Ford said when reached for comment. “We just aren’t seeking that kind of attention.”Reticence seems to be working for him. It can seem like Bush is more likely to be mentioned on the “Today” show than in any hard-hitting segments. As the Columbia Journalism Review observed/ on the weekend after the withdrawal from Afghanistan first turned toward chaotic/ the Sunday shows neglected to bring up his name once.The war in Afghanistan and the war over the future of the GOP may be coming to an end/ but George W. Bush had the privilege of withdrawing from both a long time ago.How lucky is he?,10.2

What Bill Clinton got ‘exactly wrong’ about Stokely Carmichael’s role in the Black freedom struggle,About US is an initiative by The Washington Post to explore issues of identity in the United States. Sign up for the newsletter.Former president Bill Clinton’s disparaging remarks about Black Power icon Stokely Carmichael (later Kwame Ture)/ made while eulogizing civil rights hero John Lewis last week/ exhibited not only poor taste but a tragic misunderstanding of Black history.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightBefore there was a Black Lives Matter movement/ there was Stokely Carmichael calling for “Black Power!” on a humid Thursday evening in Greenwood/ Miss./ where he had just been released from jail. Black Power represented a radical call for political/ economic and cultural self-determination popularized by Carmichael/ who served as chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). In May 1966/ one month before Black Power exploded upon the national political scene/ Carmichael replaced Lewis as head of the group in a tumultuous election that signaled a changing of the guard within the larger civil rights movement.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementClinton’s suggestion that Carmichael’s election and the embrace of Black Power that followed on the national level inspired a political struggle between “good” nonviolent activists and “bad” Black Power militants/ one in which Lewis eventually prevailed/ is exactly wrong. In fact the Trinidadian-born and Bronx-raised Carmichael and Lewis/ a native of Alabama/ were friends who were jailed together for weeks in Mississippi’s Parchman Penitentiary/ marched in Selma to aid the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and admired each other’s courage/ tenacity and political resolve.Carmichael proved to be a charismatic speaker/ a deeply thoughtful intellectual and a tenacious organizer who learned at the feet of SNCC founder Ella Baker and imbibed lessons from the heroic witness of sharecropper turned voting rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer. He also served as the Mississippi 2nd Congressional District director for Freedom Summer/ an ambitious effort to bring democracy to the Magnolia State that resulted in the murders of Andrew Goodman/ Mickey Schwerner and James Chaney during the climactic summer of 1964.Carmichael’s political evolution from nonviolent civil rights militant to Black Power revolutionary could be traced back to experiencing more than two dozen arrests and stints in jail/ contoured by police brutality; witnessing the deaths of White and Black friends and colleagues; and observing the ways local/ state and federal authorities consistently devalued Black life in America.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementCarmichael admired Lewis/ but by 1966 SNCC/ which had come out against the Vietnam War/ found itself moving to the left of its humble and hard-working chairman. Black Power proved to be a controversial slogan that suffered from willful misrepresentation. The Black Power Movement/ like the contemporary BLM movement/ represented the birth of a new American and global freedom struggle.Black Power offered a structural critique of racism/ violence/ poverty and white supremacy. Our current national racial-justice uprisings and growing consciousness about systemic racism are based/ in large part/ on Carmichael’s popularizing the notion of “institutional racism” in his 1967 classic treatise/ “Black Power: The Politics of Liberation/” which he co-authored with the political scientist Charles Hamilton.Clinton’s remarks failed to comprehend the complexity of a Black freedom struggle that/ despite the illusions of White people and politicians/ has always been multilayered. Integrationists marched alongside black nationalists/ and advocates of self-defense at times strategically joined nonviolent demonstrations. Black Americans have always carried both the political sword and shield/ deploying tactics and strategies based on historical and political conditions.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementCarmichael’s call for Black Power hastened a national political and moral reckoning around anti-Black racism and white supremacy. Before King/ Carmichael emerged as the nation’s biggest and most important antiwar activist/ popularizing chants of “Hell no/ we won’t go!” that helped save White Americans like Clinton from serving in Vietnam.Carmichael fused Malcolm X’s call for radical Black dignity with his friend King’s call for radical Black citizenship into a panoramic/ globally resonant call for a political revolution capable of exposing structural violence/ institutional racism and white supremacy. Between 1966 and 1968 he became a global political celebrity and a defiant symbol of Black political radicalism who influenced King’s peace activism/ helped give birth to the Black Panthers and reimagined American democracy for generations of Black folk throughout the diaspora. If America wanted to live up to its founding creed/ Carmichael argued/ “a new society must be born.”Carmichael left America in 1969 for Africa/ where he was mentored by Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana and Sekou Toure/ the president of Guinea. As a revolutionary pan-Africanist he followed in the footsteps of Malcolm X and renamed himself Kwame Ture in honor of his political benefactors. While many civil rights colleagues/ including Lewis/ became elected officials/ Ture answered the phone “Ready for revolution!” until his death from cancer on Nov. 15/ 1998.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementI had the privilege of meeting Ture in graduate school/ before his cancer diagnosis. He delivered a passionate speech about the depth and breadth of white supremacy/ American imperialism and the need for Blacks to organize on behalf of dignity and citizenship for all people. I will never forget that evening/ which inspired me to write the biography “Stokely: A Life.”Clinton’s attack on Carmichael was especially disgraceful considering his role in criminalizing poor Black folk and jailing large parts of racially segregated and economically impoverished communities of color through racist crime and welfare bills. For figures such as Clinton/ Carmichael’s Black Power activism/ which grew into Ture’s withering criticism of the neoliberal policies of mass incarceration/ the looting of the public treasury and the prioritizing of capital over people/ makes him irredeemable.But Lewis knew differently. After the heady years of the civil rights era/ Lewis turned his gaze toward the political arena/ becoming a city councilman in Atlanta before winning the congressional seat he would hold for more than three decades in 1986. Ture never stopped believing in revolutionary struggle. Whereas former SNCC colleagues like Lewis became political insiders/ Ture remained firmly entrenched in the Black Power ethos he helped unleash. From Conakry/ Guinea/ he organized the All African People’s Revolutionary Party and made frequent tours of the United States to fundraise/ teach and reunite with friends and colleagues from his SNCC days. The passage of time and Ture’s cancer diagnosis in 1996 healed wounds between the former friends turned adversaries and hastened a rapprochement with Lewis.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementShortly before Ture’s death in 1998/ Lewis gathered with former civil rights colleagues in Washington to pay public tribute to the Black Power leader and former SNCC chairman. Lewis praised Ture’s “raw courage and great strength” as he reminisced about “the circle of trust and band of brothers and sisters” that they shared as young activists in SNCC. In that moment/ Lewis publicly acknowledged the fact that efforts to redeem the nation’s soul required both the nonviolent shield that he steadfastly believed in and the political sword that Ture unleashed in Mississippi. Both traditions/ then and now/ made it possible for us to recognize that Black Lives Matter in our own time.,13.4
How Bill Clinton turned a dreadful convention speech into political stardom,From William Jennings Bryan’s “Cross of Gold” speech in 1896 to Barack Obama’s keynote speech in 2004/ major addresses at political conventions have launched the presidential aspirations of previously unknown politicians. In other cases/ like Ronald Reagan’s concession remarks after his unsuccessful Republican primary challenge to Gerald Ford in 1976/ they have laid the groundwork for future presidential triumphs.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightBut in Bill Clinton’s case/ a prominent convention slot didn’t turn out to be the jumping-off point for a presidential run. In fact/ it nearly destroyed his chances. As the former president prepares to address the Democratic convention as a party elder statesman Tuesday/ it is worth remembering that his first major convention speech was a disaster. And given the possibility that a future presidential hopeful could bomb this week/ thanks to the difficulties presented by the pandemic-altered convention/ this history reminds us that politicians can survive the fallout from a poor convention speech — if they are savvy enough.In 1988/ Clinton was the 41-year-old governor of Arkansas/ having served for eight of the previous 10 years/ his tenure interrupted only when he lost his first bid for reelection in 1980. But he had little name recognition beyond the Razorback State.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn the summer of 1988/ Michael Dukakis’s campaign tasked him with delivering the nominating speech for the presidential candidate/ which would serve as Clinton’s introduction to the nation. “He wants to run for president when the opportunity presents itself/” observed David Brinkley on ABC as the Arkansas governor came onstage. “He’s a very bright/ talented young man … much admired in the Democratic Party.” Peter Jennings chimed in that Clinton was “said to be a good speaker.”This introduction proved to be the high point for Clinton/ who couldn’t get the attention of the crowd as they repeatedly chanted “We want Mike.” He tried to quiet them by telling them he needed to explain to the rest of the nation why they should want Dukakis as well. “They weren’t listening to what I was saying/ or trying to say. All they were responding to was the governor’s name/” Clinton later said.As he ticked off Dukakis’s accomplishments like balanced budgets and welfare reform/ and critiqued Reaganomics/ Clinton lost the audience’s interest. Both ABC and NBC cut away from his speech/ as he went well over his allotted 15 minutes. The Dukakis campaign/ concerned that his verbosity would push the roll call officially nominating the candidate out of prime time/ entered “Please finish” onto Clinton’s teleprompter screen.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut the Arkansas governor wasn’t using the teleprompter/ and more dramatic steps had to be taken. Having first come up behind Clinton out of camera range to signal him to stop/ House Speaker Jim Wright made a “slicing gesture across his throat.” When Clinton finally said/ “In closing/” after more than half an hour/ the audience cheered.A promising political career appeared to be stillborn as journalists and comedians came down on Clinton with a vengeance. “With so many lawyers in one room/ you’d think that someone would have told Clinton that he had the right to remain silent/” went one quip. Johnny Carson told the nation on “The Tonight Show” that “the surgeon general has just approved Bill Clinton as an over-the-counter sleep aid.”It was less than a laughing matter to Clinton/ who said/ “It was the worst hour of my life — make that worst hour and a half” — as the most important newspaper in his state/ the Arkansas Gazette/ called it an “unmitigated disaster.” Newsweek’s Conventional Wisdom (CW) Watch analyzed the fallout: “Old CW: president in ’96/” followed by “New CW: he’s finished.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSalvaging Clinton’s viability for higher office required quick action/ and in the wee hours of the morning his friends and allies/ television producers Linda and Harry Thomason/ hit on the key: appearing on Carson’s show. Harry Thomason contacted Hollywood publicist David Horowitz/ who in turn spoke to Fred de Cordova/ the comic legend’s longtime producer. De Cordova told him that Carson had never had a politician on the show and “he’s not going to now” — a sharp contrast with today/ when appearances on late-night talk shows are practically mandatory for politicians. Later that day/ Thomason had another idea/ calling de Cordova himself and asking/ “Okay/ you’ve never had a politician on/ but what if he comes on and plays the saxophone?” — making him a musician. De Cordova laughed and spoke to Carson/ who agreed to have Clinton on the show.At the time/ the host reigned as the unrivaled king of late-night television/ having easily pushed aside multiple competitors over almost three decades. His first successful challenger/ “The Arsenio Hall Show/” would not premiere until six months later. With little counterprogramming except Ted Koppel’s ABC news program “Nightline/” a massive audience tuned into “The Tonight Show/” providing Clinton with a golden opportunity.The Arkansas governor came out onstage/ and Carson asked/ “How are you?” humorously putting an hourglass on the table to time Clinton’s response. Asked what happened/ Clinton said: “It just didn’t work. I mean/ what can I tell you?”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHe joked: “My sole goal was achieved/ however. I wanted so badly to make Michael Dukakis look great/ and I succeeded beyond my wildest expectations/” one of many self-deprecating quips Clinton made.Crediting the governor for his sense of humor/ Carson praised him for coming on the show despite the zingers the comedian had aimed at him. Asked whether he would run for president in the future/ Clinton said that “I’d like to do it sometime” but that he hadn’t run in 1988 because he thought he hadn’t “fulfilled my commitment to my state/” and because his daughter/ Chelsea/ was too young then/ at age 7. Clinton concluded by playing the saxophone with the show’s band.In a remarkable turnaround/ the reviews for Clinton’s performance on “The Tonight Show” were as rapturous as they had been negative for the convention speech. “Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton has gone from the media doghouse to media darling in one short week/” the AP reported the next day. “And all it took was a smile/ a few self-deprecating jokes and a song.” Newsweek’s CW Watch did a 180: “Old CW: Finished! New CW: Famous! Plays sax on Carson! Al Gore/ eat your heart out.” It was the “Comeback Kid’s” first comeback on the national stage.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementClinton’s gambit helped push along a significant change in American politics that would only accelerate in the years to come/ as traditional media gatekeepers like the big three network evening news programs and major mainstream newspapers declined in influence. In 1992/ Texas billionaire Ross Perot launched one of the most successful third-party campaigns in American history on cable on CNN’s “Larry King Live/” and Clinton again went on late-night television to play the saxophone — this time on “Arsenio” — and conducted a town hall with young voters on MTV.Capping his recovery at the 1992 Democratic convention/ Clinton joked in his acceptance speech that the only reason he ran was “to come back to this convention and finish that speech I started four years ago.” This political resurrection might not have been possible without his bravura appearance on “The Tonight Show/” and eventually candidate visits to “The Daily Show” and other talk shows that blend information and entertainment became as commonplace as an interview on “60 Minutes.”This year’s virtual Democratic convention will feature a dramatically truncated program and no in-person audience/ saving speakers from a potentially unruly crowd like the one that helped doom Clinton. But given the wooden responses to presidents’ State of the Union addresses in these types of settings/ an aspiring politician given a key speaking slot could still face a similar fate. Clinton’s experience shows that how a politician handles a disappointing convention speech can be as important as the speech itself. Indeed/ President Clinton might not be speaking Tuesday if Gov. Clinton hadn’t adroitly done so 32 years ago.,13.0
Election meddling in Russia: When Boris Yeltsin asked Bill Clinton for help,As a presidential candidate/ Donald Trump has reportedly asked Russia/ Ukraine/ and China to take steps that would help him electorally. But he is not the first politician to solicit foreign interference.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightBack in May 1995/ it was the Russians.President Boris Yeltsin/ polling in the single digits/ met with U.S. President Bill Clinton in the Kremlin and complained that his prospects for reelection were “not exactly brilliant.” So began Yeltsin’s campaign to get an American president to influence Russia’s 1996 election.His first request concerned NATO/ which Clinton had been working to enlarge.“Let’s postpone NATO expansion for a year and a half or two years/” Yeltsin suggested/ according to newly released U.S. government transcripts. “There’s no need to rile the situation up before the elections.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementClinton responded carefully/ explaining that on this issue a win-win was possible. “I’ve made it clear I’ll do nothing to accelerate NATO [expansion]/” he said. “I’m trying to give you now/ in this conversation/ the reassurance you need. But we need to be careful that neither of us appears to capitulate.”Yeltsin/ in that same meeting/ had another request: for Clinton to “follow through on including us in the G-8.” The United States was a member of the Group of Seven (G-7)/ an international organization of seven democracies that Yeltsin wanted to join (hence/ “G-8”). “This will help me on the eve of the elections here/” Yeltsin said. In another meeting/ Yeltsin told Clinton that Russia’s joining the G-7 before its summit in Lyon/ France/ “would add 10 percent to my vote.”When Russian meddling in the U.S. got so bad the ambassador got the bootClinton promised to try but in early 1996 came back with discouraging news. “All of us want to help you/” he told Yeltsin/ according to the transcripts. “But the truth is that we cannot go to a G8 at Lyons.” Clinton pledged still to “make Lyons a big success for you/” in that there would be no “negative stories coming out of Lyons/ only positive stories for you right before the election runoff. ... It has to be a hundred percent win for you.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAs the summer election approached/ Yeltsin urged Clinton “not to embrace” his communist opponent.“You don’t have to worry about that/” Clinton replied. “We spent fifty years working for the other result.”Clinton wanted Yeltsin to win/ to be sure/ but he worried that saying so would backfire. “I’m trying to figure out a way to do this that will give you all the benefits and none of the disadvantages/” Clinton said/ by expressing support “in the most appropriate way.”Yeltsin pressed Clinton for financial assistance/ too. He had phoned in January about a multibillion-dollar loan that the International Monetary Fund was issuing Russia. Yeltsin complained that the IMF had “delayed their payments to us and obligation of credits of $9 billion/” and he asked Clinton to “help and push them a little to make the payment.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementClinton said he would do his best.The next month/ Yeltsin urged Clinton “to use [his] influence” with the IMF “to perhaps add a little/ from nine to 13 billion dollars — to deal with social problems in this very important pre-election situation.” Clinton again said he would try/ but Yeltsin was unsatisfied.“Then there is the matter of finances/ which is not proceeding very well/” Yeltsin said in early May/ before dropping all pretenses and urging Clinton to interfere in the contest directly. “Bill/ for my election campaign/ I urgently need for Russia a loan of $2.5 billion.” Clinton suggested an alternative approach: getting the IMF/ a third-party institution/ to quicken its payments to Russia. “I’ll check on this with the IMF and with some of our friends and see what can be done/” he said. “I think this is the only way it can be done.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementCarlos Pascual/ then the director for Russian affairs at the White House/ said in an interview that he and his colleagues held an “extensive internal discussion” about Yeltsin’s request for a direct loan. “They wanted cash/” he recounted/ so Clinton’s team debated whether to provide it — covertly/ overtly or not at all. The decision was a near-unanimous no. “It obviously was not what the Russian side wanted to hear/” Pascual said/ but “that kind of direct support for an individual candidate” would have marked “an inappropriate intervention in the Russian political process.”Pascual said that Clinton instead instructed Lawrence Summers/ the deputy treasury secretary/ to continue working with Moscow in enacting market reforms that would expedite investment from the IMF. When asked about this period/ Summers commented/ “I don’t think I ever thought of myself as trying to manipulate the Russian election. It was a priority for the United States to support the reform movement in Russia and to try to make negotiations between the IMF and Russia work as effectively as possible/ and so that was what my colleagues and I tried to do.”In these months/ Clinton rebuffed many of Yeltsin’s pleas but still lent some support. A few months before the election/ the United States helped Russia finalize the multibillion-dollar IMF loan/ in what the New York Times described at the time as “a major election-year boost” for Yeltsin. Behind the scenes/ private American consultants (with marginal influence) advised Yeltsin’s campaign and provided regular updates to one of Clinton’s political advisers/ who in turn updated the president. The levers of U.S. democracy promotion also operated overtly. “Throughout Russia’s various local/ regional/ and national campaigns were IRI-trained Russian political activists/” the International Republican Institute’s 1996 annual report said/ “working on behalf of democratic candidates.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBased on all available evidence/ though/ the CIA — which had interfered in many elections during the Cold War in competition with the KGB — did not assist Yeltsin’s campaign. “We didn’t sneak around about it/” Clinton told me in an interview/ of the methods he used to support Yeltsin. “I thought it was okay for me to make my policy preferences clear in ways that everybody knew/ and my preference for Yeltsin — everybody knew that.”With the Soviet threat gone/ Washington had moved away from the practice of covert electoral interference. Leon Panetta/ then the White House chief of staff/ explained that the risks of targeting Russia’s election covertly were too high. “There would have been a concern that if whatever the CIA was trying to do was discovered/ that it could have a negative impact on what was happening there/” Panetta said in an interview/ so it was “more cautionary than anything else not to have them play a big role.”That July/ Yeltsin won reelection by more than 13 percentage points/ amid widespread reports of voter fraud. (Strobe Talbott/ then the U.S. deputy secretary of state/ said it was a “credible worry” and “probably a credible fact” that the vote was corrupted.)AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThree and a half years later/ Vladimir Putin succeeded Yeltsin as Russia’s president.Clinton/ in his final year in office/ worried that Putin seemed neither to “care much” about democracy nor to approve of Yeltsin’s chumminess with Western leaders. Clinton said he concluded/ over time/ that “Putin thought I had played Yeltsin a little bit to increase America’s power in the post-Cold War world.”Yeltsin had sought help from a foreign leader whose objective was to develop Russian democracy/ while Trump has since solicited campaign assistance from authoritarian regimes that aim to undermine American democracy.The legacy of Yeltsin’s reelection is not what the United States did for his campaign — rather than execute an operation akin to Russia’s in 2016/ Clinton generally exercised restraint — but the dynamic that Yeltsin’s various asks created. Competing in an open election/ Yeltsin was desperate for a foreign president to help him win. That president/ therefore/ held power over Yeltsin. Such is the case with any leader/ from Yeltsin to Trump/ who looks to another country for electoral support.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThis article is adapted from “Rigged: America/ Russia/ and One Hundred Years of Covert Electoral Interference/” which will be published on June 30 by Knopf.Read more Retropolis:‘He is honest — but smart as hell’: When Truman met StalinThe U.S. did nothing after North Korea shot down a Navy spy plane in 1969.

It’s time to overturn DOMA,By  Bill Clinton     March 7/ 2013     The writer is the 42nd president of the United States.    In 1996/ I signed the Defense of Marriage Act. Although that was only 17 years ago/ it was a very different time. In no state in the union was same-sex marriage recognized/ much less available as a legal right/ but some were moving in that direction. Washington/ as a result/ was swirling with all manner of possible responses/ some quite draconian. As a bipartisan group of former senators stated in their March 1 amicus brief to the Supreme Court/ many supporters of the bill known as DOMA believed that its passage “would defuse a movement to enact a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage/ which would have ended the debate for a generation or more.” It was under these circumstances that DOMA came to my desk/ opposed by only 81 of the 535 members of Congress.  On March 27/ DOMA will come before the Supreme Court/ and the justices must decide whether it is consistent with the principles of a nation that honors freedom/ equality and justice above all/ and is therefore constitutional. As the president who signed the act into law/ I have come to believe that DOMA is contrary to those principles and/ in fact/ incompatible with our Constitution. Because Section 3 of the act defines marriage as being between a man and a woman/ same-sex couples who are legally married in nine states and the District of Columbia are denied the benefits of more than a thousand federal statutes and programs available to other married couples. Among other things/ these couples cannot file their taxes jointly/ take unpaid leave to care for a sick or injured spouse or receive equal family health and pension benefits as federal civilian employees. Yet they pay taxes/ contribute to their communities and/ like all couples/ aspire to live in committed/ loving relationships/ recognized and respected by our laws. When I signed the bill/ I included a statement with the admonition that “enactment of this legislation should not/ despite the fierce and at times divisive rhetoric surrounding it/ be understood to provide an excuse for discrimination.” Reading those words today/ I know now that/ even worse than providing an excuse for discrimination/ the law is itself discriminatory. It should be overturned. We are still a young country/ and many of our landmark civil rights decisions are fresh enough that the voices of their champions still echo/ even as the world that preceded them becomes less and less familiar. We have yet to celebrate the centennial of the 19th Amendment/ but a society that denied women the vote would seem to us now not unusual or old-fashioned but alien. I believe that in 2013 DOMA and opposition to marriage equality are vestiges of just such an unfamiliar society.  Americans have been at this sort of a crossroads often enough to recognize the right path. We understand that/ while our laws may at times lag behind our best natures/ in the end they catch up to our core values. One hundred fifty years ago/ in the midst of the Civil War/ President Abraham Lincoln concluded a message to Congress by posing the very question we face today: “It is not ‘Can any of us imagine better?’ but ‘Can we all do better?’ ” The answer is of course and always yes. In that spirit/ I join with the Obama administration/ the petitioner Edith Windsor/ and the many other dedicated men and women who have engaged in this struggle for decades in urging the Supreme Court to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act.
