Capitol mob held dagger to America's throat - Biden,"President Joe Biden has heavily criticised former President Donald Trump on the first anniversary of the attack on the US Capitol.In a televised speech Mr Biden accused his predecessor of spreading ""a web of lies"" that led to the mob's assault. Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building on 6 January 2021 as Congress gathered to certify Mr Biden's presidential election victory.Live footage of US politicians cowering from the mob shocked the world.Mr Trump had urged protesters at a rally outside the White House shortly beforehand to ""peacefully"" march on Congress, but he also encouraged them to ""fight"" and stirred up the crowd with unsubstantiated claims of mass voter fraud in the election he had just lost. Shortly after Mr Biden's speech on Thursday Mr Trump released an angry statement hitting out at his successor. In it, he accused Mr Biden of ""failure"" and repeated false claims about the election. Democrat politicians, who have a majority in the US Congress, planned a number of events to mark the one-year anniversary of the attack - including a candlelit vigil outside the Capitol building.Many spoke about their experiences of the day, including sheltering and hiding from the rioters along with young members of staff.A House committee is conducting an inquiry, and so far investigators have arrested 725 suspects in connection with the riot. Mr Biden condemned the attackers and Mr Trump in his speech on Thursday, using some of his strongest language yet about both the Capitol riots and his predecessor.""Those who stormed this Capitol and those who instigated this incidence, held a dagger at the throat of America and American democracy"", Mr Biden said in Statuary Hall, a section of the Capitol complex that was breached by rioters.""They came here in rage, not in the service of America, but rather, in the service of one man.""The former president of the United States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election... His bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our constitution"". The US leader also warned that the threats to American democracy ""have not abated.""Later in the day House Speaker Nancy Pelosi presided over a moment of silence on the chamber floor. She praised police officers who defended lawmakers and other people who were sheltered inside as the riot raged. ""The insurrectionists targeted more than just the building. They targeted democracy itself,"" she said. Some Republicans skipped the day's commemorative gatherings. The party's Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, led a delegation to the funeral of a former senator in Atlanta, Georgia. Meanwhile Florida congressman Matt Gaetz and Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene - two provocative pro-Trump members of the House - held a news conference at the Capitol billed as a ""Republican response"" to the day's events. They repeated unsubstantiated theories that the attack was fuelled by federal agents.The mother of Ashli Babblit, a US Air Force veteran who died after being shot by police while trying to storm the House of Representatives, also spoke outside Congress. ""She was a patriot. She served this country her whole adult life,"" Micki Witthoeft told the Alabama-based Right Side Broadcasting Network.Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, in a tweet, accused Mr Biden of ""brazen politicisation"" of the 6 January riot.  Last January, Joe Biden gave an inaugural address outside the US Capitol that focused on national healing and unity.Now, standing in the centre of the building nearly a year later - after it has become clear that the nation is as divided as ever - Biden put unifying rhetoric aside and took dead aim at Donald Trump and his supporters.In some of the sharpest words directed at his predecessor since the 2020 presidential campaign, Biden condemned Trump's continued efforts to question the legitimacy of that election.Not only that, he blasted Republicans who continue to stand behind the former president and endorsed national efforts to enact election reform to counter what he said were Trump-backed attempts to undermine voting rights.This is an election year in America, with control of the US Congress and several key states hanging in the balance.Biden's rhetorical shift could represent a strategic shift, as well - a decision that the Democratic base can most effectively be rallied with anger, not hope.",0.052

Five big questions about Trump and the riot,"It has been exactly a year since a mob of Donald Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol in an attempt to halt the certification of Joe Biden's presidential victory. The most comprehensive account of the events leading up to and during that day is still ongoing, the focus of a special House of Representatives committee set up for that purpose.Established in a contentious 1 July House vote after attempts to create an independent inquiry failed, the committee - made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans - has conducted more than 250 interviews and issued at least 45 subpoenas over the course of its investigation.According to committee members, most of those contacted have agreed to co-operate. A handful of those closest to Donald Trump, however, have resisted. They've cited executive privilege, a legal principle that protects candid communications between presidents and their advisers. Two so far, Trump confidante Steve Bannon and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, have been cited for contempt of Congress by the House. Bannon is facing a criminal trial next year. As its investigatory work - and legal battles - continue, there are a number of gaps and key questions that the committee is seeking to address. Here are a few of the most pressing ones.Bennie Thompson, the chair of the congressional investigation, recently set out some of what his committee is trying to learn about the Washington DC rallies that served as a precursor to the attack on the Capitol.""We need to know who organised, planned, paid for and received funds related to those events, as well as what communications organisers had with officials in the White House and Congress,"" he said.One of those organisers, far-right conservative activist Ali Alexander, has already testified to the committee â and said he was in touch with the White House and Republican members of Congress ahead of time.The exact nature of these contacts have yet to be publicly revealed.Alexander's public opening statement during his committee deposition laid some of the blame for the day on the leaders of Women for America First, which organised the event near the White House at which Trump told his supporters to march to the Capitol. He said they did little to tamp down the violence and may have been at a hotel a block from the White House, ""drinking champagne"" when the Capitol was attacked.The activities at that hotel, the Willard Intercontinental, have been of particular interest to the congressional committee. Steve Bannon, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, former Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and Trump confidant Roger Stone were a few of the prominent names linked to hotel gatherings. The committee indicated in its contempt of Congress resolution that it believes Bannon had direct contact with Trump about the 6 January rally on at least one occasion. And Jones said that the White House asked him to lead the march to the Capitol.After weeks of calls, tweets and unsuccessful legal battles, Trump set his sights on 6 January as the pivotal day that would determine whether he could successfully overturn the results of the election.""Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,"" he tweeted on 19 December. ""Be there, will be wild!""He followed that up 11 days later with another tweet: ""JANUARY SIXTH, SEE YOU IN DC!""According to a report by the Washington Post, there was ample evidence that right-wing militant groups were preparing to travel to the Capitol on 6 January and that they were taking their guidance from the president's public statements.Federal law enforcement and the US military, however, were reluctant to make extensive moves to prepare, for fear of drawing the president's attention â and ire. A suggestion by Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Mark Milley to lock down the capital city was dismissed as being too provocative. Milley, according to the Post, was also concerned military forces dispatched to Washington could receive countermanding orders from the president.On 5 January, Bannon said on his podcast, recorded at the Willard Hotel, that a ""revolution"" was coming and ""all hell is going to break loose tomorrow"".That same evening, Trump â after reportedly hearing the growing crowds of supporters gathered outside the White House â tweeted: ""Washington is being inundated with people who don't want to see an election victory stolen by emboldened Radical Left Democrats. Our Country has had enough, they won't take it anymore!"" Several of the rally organisers, according to a report by the investigative journalism website ProPublica, were concerned that 6 January might turn violent â and the march from the White House to the Capitol was of particular concern.""A last-minute march, without a permit, without all the metro police that'd usually be there to fortify the perimeter, felt unsafe,"" Dustin Stockton, one of the White House rally organisers who has been subpoenaed by the committee, told ProPublica.Stockton wanted these concerns passed along to the White House, something he says he was assured took place. During his White House speech, however, Trump specifically encouraged rally attendees to head to the Capitol. He said they should do so ""peacefully and patriotically,"" but at other points told them to ""fight like hell"".Ever since the days of Richard Nixon, presidential scandals have been defined by two questions. What did the president know, and when did he know it? Those are still relevant in the Capitol attack investigation, but there's also a third: What did the president do once he knew?A big chunk of the committee's investigation has been trying to piece together the president's activities on 6 January â before, during and after the attack. It's why the committee has engaged in a protracted legal battle to obtain documents â call and meeting logs, notes and speech drafts â from the National Archives related to that day.Already there are some details about the pressure the president was under to respond more forcefully when the Capitol came under attack.Republican Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler has recounted how Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy phoned the president and urged him to call off the attackers. When the president demurred, the conversation devolved into an obscenity-laden shouting match.Republican Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville also spoke with the president and told him things were not going ""very good"", adding that he and Vice-President Mike Pence were being evacuated from the Capitol.""I know we've got problems,"" Trump replied.White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows provided the investigating committee with text messages and emails he received from conservative television personalities and members of the president's own family, urging him to get the president to make a public address and take more action to stop the violence.""He has to lead now,"" Donald Trump Jr wrote. ""It has gone too far and gotten out of hand.""""I'm pushing it hard,"" Meadows replied.The president's actions, however, are the big black hole in the middle of the investigation. If Meadows pushed, how did the president respond? There are reports that the president spent most of the afternoon watching television in his private White House dining room. The committee has subpoenaed White House officials who may have been around the president that day and is currently in a legal fight over government records that may help to fill in some of that black hole.On the morning of 6 January, US Park Police were already clashing with pro-Trump protestors at the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. Officers were directed to stand back and ""monitor only"".After the Stop the Steal rally and Trump's speech urging the crowd to march to the Capitol, the violence escalated. Pro-Trump rioters attacked police around the Capitol and forced their way into the building, eventually occupying the Senate chamber and ransacking the offices of congressional leaders.Shortly before the rioters entered the Capitol itself, Major General William Walker, commander of the DC National Guard, made a request to acting Secretary of Defence Christopher Miller for permission to deploy his forces to handle the crisis. That authorisation wouldn't reach Walker for more than two hours, and National Guard soldiers would not arrive in numbers at the Capitol until an hour after that.The committee is looking for further evidence of communication between the Capitol and the Pentagon and contact, if any, between the Pentagon and top White House officials, including the president.The Capitol attack represented a stunning lapse of security in a seat of US governmental power, and there's still no clear idea who bears the most responsibility.One of the more remarkable revelations in the approximately 9,000 documents former Trump Chief-of-Staff Meadows turned over to the congressional committee before he stopped co-operating were emails about a 36-page PowerPoint presentation that circulated in the White House and among congressional Republicans.The exact author of the document has yet to be determined, but it contains many familiar and long-since invalidated claims of election fraud. What is extraordinary about it, however, is the scope of its recommendations. It suggested the president declare a national state of emergency, discard all electronically tabulated ballots and put a federalised National Guard in charge of overseeing a hand recount of paper ballots in key states.Such steps would have no precedent in US history. The committee is also looking into reports that the president was pressuring his own Justice Department to declare the election corrupt, telling senior officials, according to notes taken by one of the participants, that they should ""just say the election was corrupt (and) leave the rest to me and the (Republican) congressman"".On 3 January, the president reportedly contemplated forcing the resignation of acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen and replacing him with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general who had already drafted a letter to election officials Georgia suggesting that Biden's win was fraudulent and calling on them to declare Trump the rightful winner.The president backed down after Rosen and other Justice Department officials threatened to resign en masse. Clark has so far refused to co-operate with the 6 January inquiry and could be the next individual cited for contempt of Congress.Vice-President Mike Pence was the final target of Trump's pressure â and key members of his staff are currently co-operating with the congressional investigation. The committee is seeking to learn more about a White House meeting the two had on 4 January with John Eastman, a Chapman University law professor who believed Pence could throw out state results and declare Trump the president or, at the very least, delay certification of the results until Republican-controlled legislatures could move to support Trump.According to news reports, the pressure to discard the election results continued into the evening of 6 January, with Eastman informing Pence's legal counsel that there was still time for him to refuse to certify Biden's victory, even with the Capitol still full of lingering teargas fumes and broken glass from the day's violence.",0.049
Biden to blame Trump for Capitol riot one year on,"President Joe Biden will blame Donald Trump for the US Capitol riot as he marks the anniversary of the attack on the seat of American democracy. Speaking at Congress, Mr Biden will say his predecessor holds ""singular responsibility"" for the ""chaos and carnage"", said spokeswoman Jen Psaki. Investigators have so far arrested 725 suspects in connection with the attack. Trump supporters stormed the building as Congress was meeting to certify Mr Biden's presidential election victory. Images of US lawmakers cowering from the mob in the gallery of the House of Representatives on that afternoon of 6 January 2021 shocked the world.Mr Trump had urged protesters at a rally outside the White House shortly beforehand to ""peacefully"" march on Congress, but he also exhorted them to ""fight"" and stirred up the crowd with unsubstantiated claims of mass voter fraud in the election he had just lost.The former president had planned to host a competing news conference on Thursday from his Mar-a-Lago resort home in Palm Beach, Florida. But he cancelled the event after aides reportedly warned of negative press coverage.A spokesman for Mr Trump, Taylor Budowich, said it was ""unsurprising"" that Mr Biden would spend the day ""trying to further divide our nation"" in an attempt to distract voters from rising inflation and crime and coronavirus school closures.President Biden - who rarely mentions his predecessor - will speak on Thursday morning in Statuary Hall, a section of the Capitol complex that was breached by rioters.The White House press secretary said the president's speech ""will lay out the significance of what happened at the Capitol, and the singular responsibility President Trump has for the chaos and carnage that we saw"".""He will forcibly push back on the lies spread by the former president - in an attempt to mislead the American people, and his own supporters, as well as distract from his role in what happened,"" she added.""President Biden has been clear-eyed about the threat the former president represents to our democracy,"" Ms Psaki continued. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will preside over a moment of silence at noon on the chamber floor.An inquiry into the riot is being conducted by a House committee, which is dominated by President Biden's Democrats.The panel is chasing phone records, visitor logs and other White House documents that could shed light on events leading up to the attack on Congress. They have issued legal summonses to members of Mr Trump's inner circle. Senior Republicans will mostly be outside of Washington on Thursday, with the party's Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, heading a delegation to the funeral of a former senator in Atlanta, Georgia. Mr McConnell said in the immediate aftermath of the riot that Mr Trump was ""practically and morally responsible"". Some Republican lawmakers have portrayed the invasion of Congress, in which rioters engaged in hand-to-hand combat with police, as a peaceful protest that was spoiled by a few troublemakers. But conservative Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas was lambasted on the right on Wednesday after he labelled the riot ""a violent terrorist attack"".US Attorney General Merrick Garland gave an update on the FBI inquiry on the eve of the anniversary, calling the law enforcement operation ""one of the largest, most complex and most resource-intensive investigations in our history"".""The actions we have taken thus far will not be our last,"" he said. ""We will follow the facts wherever they lead because 6 January was an unprecedented attack on the seat of our democracy.""He said 140 police officers had been assaulted, including one who was beaten and zapped repeatedly with a stun gun until he had a heart attack. Another screamed for help as rioters crushed him between doors and bludgeoned him with his own weapon, said the attorney general.Mr Garland is facing pressure from the left to prosecute the rioters more aggressively, as well as charge the former president himself and his allies. ""We build investigations by laying a foundation,"" Mr Garland said. ""We resolve more straightforward cases first because they provide the evidentiary foundation for more complex cases.""Most of the charges so far have been misdemeanours that often entail no jail time in the event of a conviction. These suspects have been charged with trespassing, disorderly conduct, parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building, and obstructing congressional proceedings.Â But 325 suspects are facing felonies - more serious counts - such as using a dangerous weapon to assault officers.Mr Garland said 300,000 tips had been submitted by private citizens, and the FBI were still hunting about 2,500 suspects.Â One rioter, an unarmed woman, Ashli Babbitt, was shot by an officer while trying to breach the House chamber. Two others died from natural causes related to cardiovascular disease and another succumbed to a drug overdose. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died a day later of natural causes after suffering two strokes while defending the building, according to medical officials. In an opinion piece for the New York Times on Wednesday, the oldest-living former US President, Jimmy Carter, warned that the country ""now teeters on the brink of a widening abyss"". ""Without immediate action, we are at genuine risk of civil conflict and losing our precious democracy. Americans must set aside differences and work together before it is too late.""A week after the riot, Mr Trump was impeached by the House for incitement of insurrection, but acquitted by the Senate, which was then controlled by his fellow Republicans. He is still seen as holding sway over the party.Of 10 Republicans who sided with Democrats in the lower chamber vote, two have resigned amid death threats, three others are facing Trump-backed election challenges, and four more have kept a low profile. Wyoming's Liz Cheney was stripped of her Republican leadership position in the House, but is spearheading the congressional inquiry into the Capitol riot.National divisions over the invasion of Congress are underscored by BBC interviews with American voters. James Clark, 69, a life-long Republican voter in Virginia, said: ""It was truly shocking. President Trump seemed intent on burning down the house before leaving Washington."" But Trump voter Keri Smith, 42, of Texas, argued that the Black Lives Matter protests were worse.""We've seen stuff crazier than that happening on a weekly basis for the past two years,"" she said. Laura Powers, a disaffected Republican, says she is ""still horrified"" by what she watched on TV that day. ""It was a horrible, dark day for democracy and it should never ever happen again,"" she said.The riot has been described as the worst assault on the Capitol since the War of 1812. It is not the only such attack since that era.In 1983 a female-led communist group bombed the US Senate. No-one was injured. One of the co-defendants in that attack had her sentence in another case commuted by US President Bill Clinton.",0.046
Trump's children refuse to testify in fraud inquiry,"Two of Donald Trump's children have refused to testify to a fraud inquiry into the family's business.Donald Jr, 44, and Ivanka, 40, were ordered to give evidence by New York Attorney General Letitia James.She opened a civil inquiry in 2019 into claims that - before he took office - Mr Trump had inflated the value of his assets to banks when seeking loans.Mr Trump's lawyers are trying to stop Ms James from questioning the former US president and his children.They have asked a judge to quash the ""unprecedented and unconstitutional"" bid for their testimony.Mr Trump sued Ms James last month, accusing the attorney general - an elected Democrat - of pursuing a politically motivated witch hunt against him, a Republican.She had requested he testify in person at her office before Friday.The court filing on Monday is the first time investigators have said they want to question Donald Jnr and Ivanka under oath.Ms James's spokesperson said: ""We are confident that our questions will be answered and the truth will be uncovered because no one is above the law.""Another son, Eric, 37, who is executive vice-president at the Trump Organization, was questioned in October 2020.Ms James's civil case is separate to an ongoing criminal investigation in Manhattan into the organisation's business practices.Donald Jr and Eric took over control of the company along with Allen Weisselberg, chief financial officer, when their father took office in January 2017. Ivanka also worked at the Trump Organization, before becoming a senior White House adviser.Mr Weisselberg pleaded not guilty in July to tax fraud charges.",0.057
Trump golf resorts claimed over £3m in furlough,"Donald Trump's golf courses and leisure businesses in Scotland claimed over Â£3m in UK government furlough money, newly-published accounts show.Covid restrictions caused substantial losses at Trump resorts in Ayrshire and Aberdeenshire with both companies reducing staff. Trump Turnberry saw turnover more than halved and it recorded a loss of more than Â£3m in 2020.The other course and resort at Balmedie also reported a loss, of Â£1.3m.Donald Trump's mother came from the Isle of Lewis, and the former US president is said to have spoken fondly of his Scottish ancestry. He opened his first golf resort on the Menie estate in Aberdeenshire in 2012, amid opposition over potential environmental damage, and later tried to stop a wind farm being built off the coast, arguing it would spoil the view. In 2014 he bought the Turnberry golf resort in South Ayrshire from a Dubai-based company.He handed control of both courses to his sons Donald Junior and Eric shortly before he became president in 2017, but he retained a financial interest. Critics of Mr Trump recently lost a legal bid to force the Scottish government to investigate how he paid for the courses, using an unexplained wealth order. According to accounts filed with Companies House, Golf Recreation Scotland Ltd, which owns the Turnberry golf course and resort, saw turnover fall from Â£19.7m in 2019 to Â£6.7m in 2020.It made a profit of Â£321,000 in 2019, and a loss of Â£3.4m in 2020.The resort was closed from 23 March to 15 July 2020, and again from 20 November to 26 April 2021.The company received a total of Â£2.3m in grants under the furlough scheme in 2020, the accounts say, while the average number of employees fell from 541 to 289.A subsidiary of the company, SLC Turnberry Ltd, made further furlough claims of between Â£435,000 and Â£1.1m from January to August 2021, according to government data not included in the published accounts. ""Government support was helpful to retain as many jobs as possible, however, uncertainty of the duration of support and the pandemic's sustained impact meant that redundancies were required to prepare the business for the long term effects to the hospitality industry,"" say the accounts, signed by Eric Trump.Trump International Golf Club Scotland Limited, which owns Donald Trump's golf course in Aberdeenshire, also saw a steep drop in turnover, from Â£3.3m in 2019 to Â£1.1m in 2020, although the company's losses rose only slightly, from Â£1.1m to Â£1.3m.The accounts note that while golf was permitted for much of the year, the Macleod House hotel was closed from 21 March onwards, and the restaurants and dining facilities only opened in June and closed again on 20 November.""The UK government furlough scheme was helpful to retain as many jobs as possible, and the majority of employees were reinstated over the course of the year,"" the accounts say.The company received Â£452,000 in from the furlough scheme in 2020, according to the accounts.Separately, government data shows that Trump International Golf Club Scotland Limited claimed between Â£85,000 and Â£205,000 of furlough money from January to August 2021.The average number of employees fell from 84 in 2019 to 63 in 2020, the accounts show.The ultimate controlling parties of both companies are the trustees of the Donald J Trump Revocable Trust, registered in Florida, the accounts say.",0.08
Inside The Matrix's prophetic legacy,"""I don't know the future... I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end, I came here to tell you how it's going to begin.""The closing monologue of 1999's The Matrix saw Keanu Reeves' heroic character Neo deliver a stark warning to the world's controlling machines, having discovered that humanity was trapped in a simulated reality.Released as society lay on the cusp of the internet revolution and fretted over the millennium bug, the film not only tapped into technological developments of the time, but posed far-flung questions about the internet, consciousness and social control that have since come to shape society.As a fourth instalment, Matrix Resurrections, hits cinemas - 18 years on from the original trilogy drawing to a close - we look at the saga's enduring and often prophetic legacy. The Matrix's co-creator siblings Lana and Lilly Wachowski loosely based their dystopian vision on the work of French academic philosopher Jean Baudrillard. Long before Reeves donned Neo's trench coat and shades, they asked that he read Baudrillard's 1981 book Simulacra and Simulation to prepare for the role.It pondered a ""desert of the real"" - a world where true reality had been replaced by the illusions of capitalism.  The film took the concept, with rebel leader Morpheus using the exact phrase when introducing Neo to the ruins of the outside world, and rewired it. Where for Baudrillard there was no escape from the simulation, the Wachowskis offered hope in the ""promise of a true natural world 'unplugged' and separate from the Matrix"", explains Prof Richard Smith, editor of The Baudrillard Dictionary. Baudrillard was not a fan of the change. ""The Matrix is surely the kind of film about the matrix that the matrix would have been able to produce,"" he said.Either way, the rabbit hole had been opened. Here are four main ways it has hacked our reality.One of the most iconic scenes in The Matrix sees Morpheus offer Neo (then still living as curious hacker Thomas Anderson) a central choice of blue pill or red pill. Pop the blue pill and return to life as Mr Anderson blissfully unaware of the matrix, the simulated world created to covertly enslave humanity. Or swallow the red pill and become enlightened to reality and the tyranny of the machines. For Prof Smith, the film's Marxist narrative evokes Plato's allegory of chained prisoners in a cave ""who mistake the shadows on the wall for reality"".  As Morpheus puts it: ""The Matrix is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth."" The pill scene ""urges human beings to free themselves from the world of appearances"", says Prof Smith.But over time the film's cultural prominence has seen the red pill metaphor rebranded online for causes far removed from its original meaning.This includes its adoption by misogynistic online groups, notably the incel movement - young men describing themselves as ""involuntarily celibate"" - part of a ""manosphere"" closely tied to a hatred of women. Reddit forum TheRedPill (TRP) was launched in 2012 with the aim of providing men with a ""sexual strategy"" to defeat what it described as a manipulative ""feminist culture"" that solely empowers women. By the time it was ""quarantined"" by Reddit in 2018 (given a content warning and only made accessible via direct links), in a community clean-up drive that eventually saw incel forum r/braincels shut completely, it had more than 400,000 followers. Research on the measure from the Australian National University suggested that rather than limit hate speech, it had simply pushed many users off-site on to self-moderated platforms.In some cases the philosophy has moved offline with deadly consequences. Plymouth gunman Jake Davison spoke of ""consuming the black pill overdose"" in YouTube videos before his August killing spree - the incel community's own term for nihilistic red pill extremism.Journalist, author and social media creator Sophia Smith Galer says the offline transition reflects how at its most basic, red pill theory appeals as a readily accessible answer and misguided outlet for life's frustrations. ""The epicentre of their problems often becomes women, rather than real, systemic failings or stereotypes in society that hurt all of us - and then many share misogynist, violent or self-harming ideas about how to improve their lives,"" she told the BBC. The ""free your mind"" ethos exploited by red pill theory has also fed into politics - a byword for the modern age of far-right populism that positions itself as anti-establishment.As a product of the alt-right, whose members are generally outspoken in their attacks on multiculturalism, globalisation and immigration, the red pill becomes ""a verb"", wrote broadcaster Danny Leigh.It opened ""the eyes of new recruits to their hated oppressors - feminists, people of colour and progressives"", he said. ""Morpheus became the face of memes that asked: 'What If I Told You Hitler Was A Socialist?'.""Fuelled by a distrust of government, the media and the status quo, the alt-right was most evidently brought into mainstream Western politics by former US President Donald Trump and his supporters.  His own daughter, Ivanka, then a White House senior adviser, proudly quote-tweeted billionaire Elon Musk to say she had ""taken"" the red pill.   The tweet represented a complete reversal of Morpheus's red pill reality, says author James Ball. ""In the film, taking the red pill is to accept an alien and horrifying truth rather than stay in a comfortable delusion,"" he said. ""And yet red-pilling, as beloved by far-right and niche online groups, is to accept vile but comfortable groupthink, to suit your own preconceptions, and see the world in a framing that suits yourself.""Lilly Wachowski responded curtly, with a blunt two-word condemnation. Actor Hugo Weaving, who played Agent Smith in the original Matrix trilogy, has also said he is ""befuddled"" by the hijacking of the film's message. ""It just goes to show how people don't read below surfaces,"" he told The Daily Beast.The fact it is now so easy to fortify yourself in an online media echo chamber - a space devoid of balanced opinion - has led to claims we are living in a ""post-truth"" era. The term was even declared word of the year by Oxford Dictionaries after the Brexit and US presidential campaigns of 2016.Messaging apps and social media have helped this climate flourish, with promotion of fake news and by using algorithms that build a version of reality tailored to our tastes - rewarding partisan news content.This year's Reuters Institute Digital News Report found that while audiences increasingly value truth, only 44% believe the news they read. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok have continued to attract more young people, but frequently offer personality and opinion-led content devoid of fact-checks, the study added. Together this can provide fertile ground for a spiral into a tailspin of misinformation and conspiracy theories. This means that the red/blue pill debate is blurring, and is today threatening to transform into a uniform purple pill of bias and distrust.Ciaran O'Connor, of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, says this is underpinned by confirmation bias, our tendency to prioritise or remember new information that supports our pre-existing opinions. ""Platforms such as Facebook are designed to profit from engagement and time spent on their platforms - and one way platforms engineer this is through algorithms. But we've seen how algorithms can inadvertently direct people to spaces where they are exposed and incentivised to engage in conspiracy content,"" he said.He points to the evolution of the QAnon conspiracy as one of the best examples of this in action.  Its momentum eventually snowballed into January's US Capitol riots, fuelled in part by former President Trump's false claims of widespread election interference. Despite intensified efforts to ban QAnon content on YouTube, Facebook and elsewhere, the once niche online conspiracy had already ""gone global"", says Mr O'Connor.  The irony is that although conspiracy theory followers believe they are emulating Neo by following the white rabbit and ""unplugging"" in search of truth, in fact the opposite is happening - they are being distracted within the very system they think they are exposing.  However, digital information sharing has not solely reinforced mistruth and protected the establishment. The original WikiLeaks data dump and Edward Snowden's mass surveillance revelations, while controversial in their practice, uncovered widespread government wrongdoing. Social media has equally shown it can act as a liberating, uniting force, empowering democratic coups and social justice initiatives.Beyond shifting perceptions of truth, our increasingly interconnected online presence, known as a digital footprint, realises elements of the original Matrix film in ways that felt pure science fiction at the time of release.Our willingness, tacitly or otherwise, to share personal information and agree to monitoring via technology, from mobile phones apps to machine learning tools like smart speakers, has allowed a very detailed picture of our personal lives and habits to be generated.The Cambridge Analytica data scandal showed how this information can be used to target, influence, and potentially swing voters in political systems.Elsewhere, the overlap between our digital and real life profiles has been increased by augmented reality and virtual reality, which mirror the way the rebels in the original film plug in and out of the simulation. Facebook recently announced long-term plans to create a virtual metaverse - allowing more of life to be lived out immersively online. By the same token, the way Morpheus's freedom fighters hack the matrix system to install programmes, scenarios or different appearances reflects today's real-world rise of deepfake videos - a computer-generated copy that aims to impersonate someone. Transhumanism, the belief that humans can improve beyond their physical and mental limitations and ""upgrade"" their bodies by incorporating technology, also matches the way characters in the film can download skillsets and learn to manipulate physics laws within the simulation. The film's nod to identity and the body as malleable has been strengthened by Lilly Wachowski, who retrospectively described it as a trans allegory when speaking to Netflix last year.""That was the original intention but the corporate world wasn't quite ready,"" said the filmmaker, who came out as trans along with her sister Lana after the original trilogy was released.     So where does all this leave The Matrix as we look to the future?Some believe full-circle. In 2016, a group of physicists suggested it is likely that our universe is not real and is instead a giant simulation run by a higher power. Technologists in Silicon Valley, including Tesla boss Elon Musk, have supported the idea.As implausible as it sounds, it fits the legacy of The Matrix.

Trump sues NY attorney to block company inquiry,"Donald Trump has sued New York state Attorney General Letitia James, seeking to block her from continuing to investigate his company.The former US president argues she has violated his constitutional rights by pursuing a politically-motivated probe.Ms James says the investigation ""will continue undeterred"".She opened a civil inquiry in 2019 into claims that - before he took office - Mr Trump had inflated the value of his assets to banks when seeking loans. The lawsuit comes less that two weeks after Ms James indicated that Mr Trump could be questioned under oath next month as part of the inquiry.Mr Trump is also suspected of understating his assets to lower his taxes.Ms James' office has been seeking documents on four Trump Organization properties in Manhattan, upstate New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.In May, Ms James, a Democrat, told the BBC that her team had ""informed the Trump Organization that our investigation into the Organization is no longer purely civil in nature"".The former president, who is a Republican, has described the inquiry as a witch hunt.Throughout his presidency from 2017 to 2021, Mr Trump resolutely refused to reveal his tax returns, despite coming under great pressure to do so.Civil cases usually have to do with injury to individuals or other private parties, including businesses; criminal law applies in cases where the damage is thought to affect society at large, including the state.",0.033
Trump ex-chief of staff in contempt of Congress,"The US House of Representatives has voted to hold ex-Trump Chief of Staff Mark Meadows in contempt of Congress, paving the way for prosecution. Last week, Mr Meadows said he would stop co-operating with a congressional panel investigating the 6 January riot at the US Capitol. The vote largely fell along party lines, with the Democrat-run chamber voting 222 in favour and 208 against. He could face up to a year in prison and a $100,000 (Â£75,631) fine. Mr Meadows will now be referred to the Justice Department, which will ultimately decide whether to formally charge him. Trump supporters breached the US Congress building on 6 January as lawmakers were meeting to certify the election result.Before last week, Mr Meadows had provided the committee about 9,000 pages of records regarding the events, before reversing course and claiming that his communications are protected by executive privilege - a legal principle designed to shield certain White House records. After Mr Meadows twice refused to appear at scheduled depositions, on Monday the congressional panel voted unanimously to recommend that the House hold him in contempt. ""Mr Meadows started by doing the right thing - co-operating. He handed over records that he didn't try to shield behind some excuse,"" said Representative Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the 6 January committee. ""When these records raise questions - as these most certainly do - you have to come in and answer those questions,"" Mr Thompson added. ""He changed his mind and told us to pound sand. He didn't even show up."" On Monday, the committee released messages sent to Mr Meadows while the riot was underway, revealing that key Trump administration officials and allies were concerned about what was happening. Among those who contacted Mr Meadows was Donald Trump Jr, who wrote ""he's [the president] has got to condemn this"" as soon as possible.Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, a vocal defender of Mr Trump, took to the House floor ahead of the vote to decry the measure. ""Mark Meadows is our former colleague,"" Mr Jordan told lawmakers. ""He is a good man, and he is my friend. And this, this is as wrong as it gets.""With the vote, Mr Meadows becomes the second Trump-era official to be referred to the justice department to face charges, following strategist Steve Bannon. In November, Mr Bannon was formally charged. Separately on Tuesday, Washington DC officials said they would sue the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, two groups that were heavily involved with the Capitol riot.The civil suit seeks to recoup funds they say were spent defending the city and federal buildings from the pro-Trump mob.",0.089
Trump’s son urged him to intervene in Capitol riot,"Donald Trump's son sent the White House chief-of-staff frantic texts calling for his father to intervene during the Capitol riot on 6 January.A committee investigating the violence was shown messages from Donald Trump Jr to Mark Meadows, saying the deadly riot had ""gotten out of hand"".He was one of several senior political and media figures who texted Mr Meadows with their concerns.The president was criticised for not intervening early on in the riot.He did eventually urge his supporters to ""go home"", but not before the pro-Trump mob had stormed the Capitol building, where Congress were meeting to certify Joe Biden's presidential election win. In the newly-revealed messages to Mr Meadows, Mr Trump Jr used strong terms to suggest his father should act.""He's got to condemn this shit ASAP,"" the younger Trump wrote, according to US lawmaker Liz Cheney, vice-chair of the committee investigating if the former president had foreknowledge of the riot.The former president has repeatedly denied suggestions that he encouraged his supporters to act violently.The messages had been submitted by Mr Meadows, who faces criminal contempt charges for refusing to comply with the committee's inquiry.""As the violence continued, one of the President's sons texted Mr Meadows,"" said Ms Cheney, the Republican lawmaker representing the state of Wyoming, told the Select Committee on Monday. She said Mr Meadows responded to Mr Trump Jr's plea by writing back: ""I'm pushing it hard. I agree.""""Still, President Trump did not immediately act,"" Ms Cheney said, and ""Donald Trump Jr texted again and again"".""Quote, 'We need an Oval office address. He [ex-President Trump] has to lead now. It has gone too far and gotten out of hand,' end quote.""On Monday, it was also revealed that at around the same time several leading hosts of the Fox News TV channel - which is widely seen as being sympathetic to Donald Trump and the Republican party - were also urging Mr Meadows to get the then-president to stop the rioting. ""Mark, president needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home. This is hurting all of us. He is destroying his legacy,"" according to a text message by Laura Ingraham. Meanwhile, Brian Kilmeade, another Fox News star, wrote: ""Please get him [ex-President Trump] on TV. Destroying everything you have accomplished.""Summing up the submitted messages, Ms Cheney said: ""These texts leave no doubt. The White House knew exactly what was happening at the Capitol.""Former President Trump, his son, and the two Fox News hosts have not publicly commented on the latest developments.On Tuesday, Washington DC officials said they would sue the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, two groups that were heavily involved with the Capitol riot. The civil suit seeks to recoup funds that they say were spent defending the city and federal buildings from the pro-Trump mob. ",0.075
Trump uses expletive to attack ex-ally Netanyahu,"Former US President Donald Trump has launched a scathing attack on his once-close ally, ex-Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing him of disloyalty.Mr Trump said he was furious at Mr Netanyahu for the way he congratulated Joe Biden on his election victory, using an expletive towards him.He also said he believed he saved Israel from destruction.Mr Trump made the comments in interviews for a book about his role in Middle East peace-making.The US administration under Mr Trump, from 2017-2021, is considered the most favourable towards Israel in the two countries' history. Mr Netanyahu served as Israeli prime minister while Mr Trump was in office, and the two men were portrayed as having particularly warm personal relations, often publicly praising one another.Speaking to Israeli journalist Barak Ravid for his book Trump's peace: The Abraham Accords and the Reshaping of the Middle East, Mr Trump accused Mr Netanyahu of congratulating too quickly Mr Trump's successor Joe Biden on winning the 2020 US election. Mr Trump disputed the election result, though his claims were never upheld.""The first person who congratulated [Joe Biden] was Bibi [Benjamin] Netanyahu, the man that I did more for than any other person I dealt withâ¦ Bibi could have stayed quiet. He has made a terrible mistake.""He was very early,"" Mr Trump said. ""Like earlier than most. I haven't spoken to him since. [Expletive] him.In actual fact, Mr Netanyahu was not the first foreign leader to congratulate Mr Biden. He also tweeted his gratitude towards Mr Trump minutes later.In other comments, Mr Trump says: ""Nobody did more for Bibi. And I liked Bibi,"" adding: ""I still like Bibi. But I also like loyalty.""Mr Netanyahu was ousted from office in June this year after failing to form a government following deadlocked elections.In the interviews given in April and July, Mr Trump also expresses his belief that he saved Israel from destruction.""I'll tell you what - had I not come along, I think Israel was going to be destroyed. OK. You want to know the truth? I think Israel would have been destroyed maybe by now.""In response to Mr Trump's comments, Mr Netanyahu told Axios: ""I highly appreciate President Trump's big contribution to Israel and its security. I also appreciate the importance of the strong alliance between Israel and the US and therefore it was important for me to congratulate the incoming president.""As US president, Mr Trump took a series of steps in support of Mr Netanyahu, including controversially recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, sparking fury across the Arab world. Israel has occupied East Jerusalem - claimed by the Palestinians as the capital of their own hoped-for state - since 1967.Mr Trump also declared Israeli settlements in occupied territory were not illegal, putting the US out of step with the UN, and recognised Israeli sovereignty over the Syrian Golan Heights, also occupied by Israel since 1967. Mr Netanyahu unveiled a planned settlement there called Trump Heights in return.",0.121
US court rejects Trump's request to block files,"A US appeals court has rejected a bid by former President Donald Trump to block Capitol riot investigators from accessing his White House records.Mr Trump, a Republican, has argued that his past communications are protected by executive privilege, under which presidential files can be kept secret. But President Joe Biden has waived executive privilege on the documents.Lawmakers are trying to find out if Mr Trump had foreknowledge of the riot, which took place on 6 January.Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building as Congress was meeting to certify Joe Biden's presidential election result.Mr Trump has refused to acknowledge losing the election to Mr Biden last year, making claims - without evidence - of mass voter fraud. He is expected to appeal against Thursday's decision, which will then be passed to the Supreme Court.Announcing their ruling, three judges from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the former president had provided ""no basis"" for them to grant his request to override Mr Biden's judgment. They said both branches of government agreed that there was a unique legislative need for the records, which were directly relevant to the attack. The inquiry is being conducted by a committee set up by the House of Representatives, which is dominated by President Biden's Democrats.The panel wants to see phone records, visitor logs and other White House documents that could shed light on events leading up to the attack on Congress.Mr Trump's lawyers had said in an earlier filing to the appeals court that their client could ""suffer irreparable harm through the effective denial of a constitutional and statutory right to be fully heard on a serious disagreement between the former and incumbent president"".Following the Capitol riot, Mr Trump was impeached by the lower house of Congress, but cleared by the then Republican-dominated upper house - the Senate - of inciting an insurrection. More than 670 people have been arrested for the invasion of the Capitol complex.",0.071
Lawmakers to hold Trump chief of staff in contempt,"US lawmakers investigating the January Capitol riot say they will hold former Trump chief of staff, Mark Meadows, in criminal contempt.The House Select Committee said it had ""no choice"" but to seek charges over his refusal to comply with its inquiry.Mr Meadows had previously provided the bipartisan panel with information, but said this week he would not co-operate.On Wednesday, he sued the committee members, seeking to nullify subpoenas they issued.The suit alleges that ""overly broad and unduly burdensome"" subpoenas sent to Mr Meadows violate legal protections for senior advisors to a president, and charge the committee with using excessively broad subpoenas to obtain his phone records.Mr Meadows will be the third ex-Trump aide to be held in contempt by the panel.In a letter sent to Mr Meadows on Tuesday, committee chairman Bennie G Thompson objected to Mr Meadows' argument that the information lawmakers wanted from him was protected by executive privilege - a legal principle that protects many White House communications from being shared. ""There is no legitimate legal basis for Mr Meadows to refuse to cooperate with the Select Committee,"" wrote Mr Thompson, who is a Democratic representative for Mississippi.Mr Meadows had said initially he would appear before the House panel this week, and had already provided the committee with some 6,000 pages worth of documents, including messages from his personal phone. In one exchange from 6 November 2020, Mr Meadows discussed appointing alternate electors (people who cast the official votes for president) in certain states, which effectively undermined some of the presidential election results. ""I love it,"" Mr Meadows wrote in a message to a Congress member. Also included in the text messages is an exchange ""between Meadows and an organiser of the January 6th rally"", Mr Thompson wrote. But after the committee said they would file formal criminal contempt charges, Mr Meadows filed a lawsuit against Mr Thompson, Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and the panel of seven Democrats and two Republicans. Mr Meadows' about-face comes during the release of his memoir, which includes revelations about his former boss, particularly about the time Mr Trump had Covid-19. The disclosures have reportedly angered the former president. In his book, Mr Meadows wrote that Mr Trump was ""mortified"" by the events of 6 January. Donald Trump had urged his former aides to reject any requests to testify in front of the House panel, claiming executive privilege exempts them from cooperation. The House committee will next vote to hold Mr Meadows in contempt. If the House of Representatives upholds with charge, the case will be referred to the Justice department, which has the final say on bringing charges. ",0.077
Wall Street watchdogs probe Trump media firm deal,"Donald Trump's deal to float his social media firm on the stock market is being investigated by Wall Street watchdogs.Regulators are probing Digital World Acquisition Corp, the firm set to merge with Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG).  According to a filing on Monday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requested documents about its investors and trading.TMTG plans to launch a social media app called Truth Social early next year. The filing states that the SEC also asked to see information detailing the relationship between Digital World and TMTG.It also said that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is probing the deal as well.The SEC told the BBC it does not comment on the ""existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation"". The BBC has contacted TMTG for comment.The SEC was requested by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren last month, to investigate the proposed merger of the two firms for potential violations of securities laws. Digital World is a so-called special purpose acquisition company (Spac) or ""blank cheque company"". Spacs, which became a major story in the US stock market at the start of this year, are shell companies that are set up with the sole purpose of merging with a private firm to take it public. However, they have lost much of their lustre after some of the companies that merged with them failed to deliver on their ambitious financial projections.On Saturday, Mr Trump's firm said it had secured $1bn from ""a diverse group of institutional investors"" without revealing who they were. According to reports, the social media venture is now valued at almost $4bn. The former US president is still banned from Twitter and Facebook following the 6 January attack on the US Capitol.At the time he was banned Mr Trump had 89 million followers on Twitter, 33 million on Facebook and 24.5 million on Instagram, according to a presentation on his company's website.",0.057

It comes as Mr Trump remains banned from Twitter and Facebook following the attack on the US Capitol in January.""$1bn sends an important message to Big Tech that censorship and political discrimination must end,"" he said. ""As our balance sheet expands, Trump Media & Technology Group will be in a stronger position to fight back against the tyranny of Big Tech.""Mr Trump announced plans to launch Truth Social earlier this year, saying it would allow conversation ""without discrimination on the basis of political ideology"".The Trump Media & Technology Group has partnered on the project with Digital World Acquisition, a so called special purpose acquisition company (Spac) or ""blank cheque company"". Spacs, which became a major story in the US stock market at the start of this year, are shell companies that are set up with the sole purpose of merging with a private firm to take it public. However, they have lost much of their lustre after some of the companies that merged with them failed to deliver on their ambitious financial projections.On Saturday, Mr Trump's firm said it had secured the $1bn from from ""a diverse group of institutional investors"" without revealing who they were. According to reports, the social media venture is now valued at almost $4bn.It would appear to underscore the former US president's ability to attract strong financial backing despite the controversy surrounding his time in charge.Mr Trump was banned from top social media platforms after the 6 January attack by his supporters on the US Capitol in Washington DC amid concerns the then-president would inspire further violence. It came after Mr Trump made claims, without evidence, of widespread fraud in last year's presidential election.Many Wall Street firms snubbed the opportunity to invest in the former president's new venture, according to Reuters. But some hedge funds, family investment firms and high net-worth individuals have backed it.Mr Trump had 89 million followers on Twitter, 33 million on Facebook and 24.5 million on Instagram at the time he was blocked, according to a presentation on his company's website.He has also repeatedly dropped hints that he might seek the presidency again in 2024.However, there have been questions about the state of the former president's finances. Last month a congressional committee found he had ""grossly exaggerated"" the profitability of his Washington DC hotel - claims the Trump Organization called ""misleading"".Trump Media & Technology Group's partnership with Digital World Acquisition has already attracted scrutiny. Last month Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the planned merger for potential violations of securities laws. The SEC has declined to comment on whether it plans any action.Truth Social is scheduled for a full rollout in the first quarter of 2022. It is the first of three stages in the Trump Media plan, followed by a subscription video-on-demand service called TMTG+ that will feature entertainment, news and podcasts, according to the news release.In a slide deck on its website, the company envisions eventually competing against Amazon.com's AWS cloud service and Google Cloud.",0.084
Rights groups condemn Trump migrant policy return,"US human rights groups have criticised the reinstatement of a Trump-era policy requiring asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while claims are processed. The American Immigration Council said it was a dark day for the US and the rule of law.US President Joe Biden had suspended the policy, calling it ""inhumane"", but was ordered by courts to resume it.Under the policy, thousands of migrants were forced to stay in dangerous conditions on the Mexican border.  But Republicans have welcomed the decision as a way to restore order in the border regions.Mexico has now agreed to accept the policy, known as Remain in Mexico, in exchange for concessions such as a shorter turnaround time for asylum decisions and a US-Mexico development programme for Central America.Mr Biden's administration has kept up one other major Trump-era border policy: Title 42, which allows for the quick expulsion of migrants on public health grounds.Former US President Donald Trump introduced the programme, then known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, to send more than 60,000 asylum applicants back to Mexico. Migrants were often left waiting in Mexico for months, where they sometimes fell prey to criminal gangs. According to charity Human Rights First, there have been more than 1,500 publicly reported cases of kidnapping, rape, torture and other abuses against migrants returned to Mexico.Mr Biden suspended the programme almost immediately after taking office, as part of a campaign pledge to reverse hardline immigration policies enacted by his predecessor. In June, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas terminated the policy.But in August, a federal court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, ruled that the policy had been improperly cancelled.The Biden administration is appealing against the decision. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Thursday that the president stood by past remarks about the ""unjustified human costs"" of the programme.""But we also believe in following the law,"" she said.The policy has been revamped to address Mexico's concerns, including to limit time spent for each asylum application to six months. Implementation is expected to begin next week at ports of entry in Texas and California. Immigration has again proven to be the main prism through which Washington views its relationship with Mexico. Â It seems the numbers of people arriving at the US southern border - and the effect that is having on President Biden's standing in the polls - has meant the administration is happy enough to reinstate the law - albeit having been ordered to do so by the courts. Yet one might well as ask what Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has to gain by agreeing to carry out his side of the policy, namely accepting thousands of asylum-seekers into Mexican border towns to await their day in a US court. On the surface, he has added a more humanitarian veneer to the policy, tying down a timeline of 180 days in which asylum cases should be heard and development funds for Central America under the name ""Planting Opportunities"". But in reality, this is a political risk he can afford to take. Â With asylum seekers likely to be living again in precarious conditions in dangerous border towns, the Mexican president may be considering that migrants will have less incentive to travel north. And in the meantime, he has undoubtedly created some useful leverage with President Biden in other areas. The move was condemned by pro-immigration groups and lawmakers from Mr Biden's own Democratic party. In a statement, American Immigration Council policy director Jorge Loweree rejected the Biden team's ""claims that it can administer the Remain in Mexico program in a more humane manner"", adding: ""Today is a dark day for the United States and for the rule of law.""By expanding the programme to include any migrants from the western hemisphere - including non-Spanish speaking groups such as Haitians - Mr Biden had ""made the programme even broader than under Trump"", the group said.The UNHCR, the United Nations refugee agency, also condemned the move and refused to help implement the policy. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said the resumption would lead to ""horrific abuse, including torture, rape, and death"".But Republican House Leader Kevin McCarthy welcomed the programme's reinstatement.""It is unfortunate that it took litigation to force the Biden administration's hand to apply this common-sense measure,"" he said.Texas attorney-general Ken Paxton, a conservative Republican, described the development as a ""huge win"".""I will continue to fight to restore safety and order along our southern border, making sure that this essential programme is implemented in full compliance with the court's order,"" he said, quoted by the Associated Press.But Texas Democratic Congresswoman Veronica Escobar told The Hill newspaper that the policy ""erodes our values as a country"" and is ""a violation of asylum processing"".She called for the White House to aggressively fight the order in court, and criticised Mr Biden for not having fixed the system after nearly a year in office. Democratic Senator Bob Menendez urged Mr Biden to ""make every effort"" to overturn ""this xenophobic and anti-immigrant policy for good"".",0.1
US and Mexico to restart 'Remain in Mexico' policy,"Would-be asylum seekers who cross the US southern border will be sent to Mexico to await claims decisions following the restart of a controversial programme.The US and Mexican governments said Thursday that they will reinstate the Trump-era policy known as Remain in Mexico.US President Joe Biden had suspended the programme, calling it ""inhumane"".A court order forced a reversal, however.Former President Donald Trump used the programme, then known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, to send more than 60,000 asylum applicants back to Mexico. Migrants were often left waiting in Mexico for months, where they sometimes fell prey to criminal gangs. According to charity Human Rights First, there have been more than 1,500 publicly reported cases of kidnapping, rape, torture and other crimes against migrants returned to Mexico.Mr Biden, a Democrat, had suspended the programme almost immediately after taking office, as part of a campaign pledge to reverse hardline immigration policies enacted by his predecessor. In June, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas terminated the policy.The programme's resurrection follows an August ruling by federal court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, who found that the Biden administration had improperly cancelled the policy earlier this year.Asked about the resumption of the policy on Thursday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that both Mr Biden and Mr Mayorkas stand by previous statements describing the programme as one with ""endemic flaws"" with ""unjustified human costs"".""But we also believe in following the law,"" she said.The revived policy includes new steps to address Mexico's human rights concerns about the policy - reportedly a caveat for their participation. Under guidance from Mexico, the US will now include providing Covid-19 vaccinations for migrants, and expanded exemptions, such as for those with physical and mental health challenges. Also at Mexico's request, the US agreed to limit time spent to six months for each asylum applicant. The Mexican government said it was committed to maintaining the health and safety of migrants. The administration is appealing Judge Kacsmaryk's order, but was legally required to enforce the ruling. Judge Kacsmaryk acknowledged that the policy could only be implemented with Mexico's consent, prompting a months-long negotiation between the two countries. Implementation is expected to begin next week, first in El Paso and Brownsville, Texas, as well as San Diego, California. The move was slammed by the pro-immigration Washington-DC based American Immigration Council.""We categorically reject the Biden administration's claims that it can administer the Remain in Mexico program in a more humane manner,"" the group said in a statement, adding: ""Today is a dark day for the United States and for the rule of law.""They added that by expanding the programme to include any migrants from the Western Hemisphere - including non-Spanish speaking groups such as Haitians - Mr Biden ""made the programme even broader than under Trump"".",0.042
